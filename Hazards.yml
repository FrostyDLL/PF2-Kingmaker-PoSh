            Complexity: Simple
            Stealth: DC 10 or detect magic
            Description: A roiling red orb, forged from a drop of the god Rovagug’s blood, rains fire from the sky when a specified condition is met.
            Disable_DC: Thievery DC 48 (legendary) to imbue thieves’ tools with aspects representing Asmodeus and Sarenrae and use them to drain away the orb’s power over 10 minutes; the character attempting this check takes 5 fire damage each round until the orb is depleted
            Trigger: Burn It All [reaction] (death, divine, evocation, fire); Trigger A special condition set by the trap’s creator occurs; this is typically the event of their death. Effect Fire rains from the sky in a 100-mile radius, dealing 10d6 fire damage to creatures and objects in the area. Each creature or object can attempt a DC 46 basic Reflex save. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly. This is not enough damage to completely burn away a forest or level an entire mountain or city, but it typically kills most creatures in the area.

            Complexity: Complex
            Stealth: +7 (trained)
            Description: A cloud of invisible Magical sensors in a 10-foot radius surrounds an invisible wall or floor rune the size of the creature to be summoned.
            Disable_DC: Acrobatics DC 15 to approach without triggering the trap followed by Thievery DC 17 (trained) to erase the rune, or dispel magic (1st level; counteract DC 15) to counteract the rune
            Trigger: Summon Monster [reaction] (arcane, conjuration, summon); Trigger A creature enters the cloud of Magical sensors. Effect This trap summons a specific level 1 creature, determined when the trap is created. The creature rolls initiative and remains for 2d6 rounds, after which the spell ends and the creature disappears. The creature also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The summoned creature can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.
            Reset: The trap resets each day at dawn
            Upgrade: You can make a summoning rune of nearly any level. It summons a creature of a level equal to the trap’s level. Use Table 10–5 DCs by Level on page 503 to determine the Thievery DC and spell DC, using the trap’s level and applying a hard adjustment (+2). The Stealth modifier for the trap is equal to this number – 10. Stronger summoning runes usually require expert proficiency or better in Perception to find, and they might require a higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable.

            Stealth: +10 (trained); DC 22 (expert) to notice the water spouts once the pit opens
            Description: A trapdoor covers a 10-foot-square pit that’s 30 feet deep and has 5 feet of water at the bottom. Four water spouts in the walls connect to hidden water tanks. Each water spout extends out of a different wall, 6 inches from the top of the pit.

            Trigger: Pitfall [reaction] Trigger A creature walks onto the trapdoor. Effect The triggering creature falls in and takes damage from the fall, reduced by 5 feet for falling into the water (typically 12 bludgeoning damage). A creature can Grab an Edge to avoid falling. The trapdoor then slams shut, and the hazard rolls initiative.
            Routine: (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn for each disabled water spout. On each of the trap’s actions, a spout pours water, increasing the depth of the water by 5 feet. Once the pit is full of water, the pit stops using actions, but creatures in the pit begin drowning.
            Reset: The trap can be reset if the door is manually reengaged and the water tanks refilled; it can be reset without draining the pit, but doing so renders it less effective.

            Stealth: +12 (trained) (or –10 and no minimum proficiency if the surface is disturbed)
            Description: A 15-foot-wide patch of water and sand attempts to submerge creatures that step onto it.
            Disable_DC: Survival DC 18 (trained) to disturb the surface
            Trigger: Submerge [free-action] Trigger A Huge or smaller creature walks onto the quicksand. Effect The triggering creature sinks into the quicksand up to its waist. The quicksand rolls initiative if it hasn’t already.
            Routine: Routine (1 action) On its initiative, the quicksand pulls down each creature within it. A creature that was submerged up to its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and has to hold its breath to avoid suffocation. A creature in the quicksand can attempt a DC 20 Athletics check to Swim to either raise itself by one step if it’s submerged to its neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if it’s submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. A creature that Swims out of the quicksand escapes the hazard and is prone in a space adjacent to the quicksand patch. Other creatures can Aid the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own DC 20 Athletics check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check.
            Reset: The hazard still submerges anyone who walks in, but the surface doesn’t become hidden again until it settles over the course of 24 hours.

            Disable_DC: Thievery DC 21 (trained) twice on the pillar, or Thievery DC 19 (expert) once on the control panel deactivates the whole trap. Breaking the control panel prevents anyone from disabling the trap using the control panel and prevents the trap from deactivating automatically (see Reset below).

            Trigger: Rising Pillar [reaction] (attack); Trigger A creature steps on one of the trapped floor tiles. Effect The trap pops up in a grid intersection and makes a spinning blade attack against one adjacent creature (if any), then rolls initiative.
            Routine: Routine (3 actions) The trap uses its first action to make a spinning blade Strike against each adjacent creature, its second action to move straight in a random direction (roll 1d4 to determine the direction), and its third action to make a spinning blade Strike against each adjacent creature. This trap doesn’t take a multiple attack penalty. Speed 10 feet Melee [one-action] spinning blade +12, Damage 2d10+5 slashing

            Trigger: Wheel Spin [reaction] Trigger A creature enters the sensor’s detection area. Effect The wheel begins to spin and rolls initiative.
            Routine: Routine (2 actions) On its initiative, the trap uses its first action to spin, then stops. Roll 1d6 to determine which segment is topmost when the wheel stops spinning. The wheel uses its second action to replicate the spell listed for that segment (3rd level, DC 24, spell attack roll +14). This spell’s target is centered on or otherwise includes the nearest creature in the area. This increases the spell’s range to 100 feet if necessary. Any spell cast by this trap is arcane. Spells are sleep, paralyze, lightning bolt (100-foot line), blindness, acid arrow, ray of enfeeblement.
            Reset: The trap deactivates and resets if 1 minute passes without any creature moving within range of its sensor.

            Trigger: Dart Volley [reaction] (attack); Trigger A creature enters the hallway or ends its turn in the hallway. Effect The trap makes a poisoned dart Strike against the triggering creature, then rolls initiative.
            Routine: Routine (1 action) The trap launches one dart against every creature in the gallery as 1 action. Because it launches darts continuously, the trap can also use the Continuous Barrage free action (see below) to launch darts at each creature during that creature’s turn. Ranged poisoned dart +21, Damage 3d4 piercing plus flesset poison; no multiple attack penalty Continuous Barrage [free-action] Trigger A creature within the active gallery finishes an action.

            Description: Four gated channels carved into stone allow lava to flow into a 15-foot-tall room; the floor can withdraw to allow the hardened lava to fall into a chamber beneath.

            Trigger: Flume Activation [reaction] Trigger A creature tries to leave the room. Effect The exits seal instantly and the trap rolls initiative.
            Routine: Routine (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled channel each turn. On each action, a different channel spews lava, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each creature within 10 feet of the channel (DC 27 basic Reflex save), and increasing the depth of the lava in the room by 1 foot (4 feet per round if all the channels are active). A creature that starts its turn in lava takes 8d6 fire damage and is immobilized until it Escapes the hardening lava (DC 27). The creature might suffocate if covered in lava. Lava from the previous round hardens fully at the start of the trap’s turn, effectively raising the floor of the room. Once the room is full of lava, the trap stops taking actions, but creatures in the room remain stuck until the floor opens and the trap resets.
            Reset: The trap deactivates and resets after 1 hour by withdrawing the floor, cracking and dumping the hardened lava (and any creatures trapped inside) into the chamber. Creatures fall 40 feet, taking falling damage (typically 17 bludgeoning damage).

            Stats: Hardness 22, HP 88 (BT 44) per telekinetic cloud
            Trigger: Agitate [reaction] (arcane, evocation); Trigger A creature stays in the room for at least 6 seconds. Effect Each telekinetic decoration constructs a cloud of objects in the room (three clouds total) and the trap rolls initiative. The creatures in the room when the trap is triggered become the trap’s targets, regardless of whether they leave the room or other creatures later enter the room. Each decoration targets a different creature if possible. A target creature that moves at least 1 mile from the trap ceases being a target, at which point the decoration designates a new target.
            Routine: Routine (9 actions) Each decoration uses 3 of the trap’s actions each turn, and the trap loses 3 actions each turn for every decoration that is disabled. A decoration uses its first action to move its cloud of objects up to 200 feet, its second action to make the objects Strike, and its third action to add more objects to the cloud, increasing its damage by 1d12 (to a maximum of 4d12+10). If a decoration’s cloud is already at maximum damage, it does nothing with its third action. If a decoration’s cloud has been destroyed, the decoration instead spends its first action to create a new cloud of objects inside the room (using the starting damage value) and then its second and third actions to have the cloud move and attack. Melee [one-action] objects +24, Damage 2d12+10 bludgeoning
            Reset: The trap deactivates and resets 10 minutes after it has no target creatures (because the creatures either moved too far away or died).

            Trigger: Reflection of Evil [reaction] (arcane, conjuration, teleportation); Trigger A non-evil creature is reflected in the mirror. Effect The mirror absorbs the creature into the mirror, replacing it with an evil mirror duplicate (DC 34 Reflex to avoid being absorbed into the mirror), and rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The mirror absorbs another reflected creature into the mirror and replaces it with a mirror duplicate. Mirror duplicates attack on their own initiative, using the same statistics as the original creature, but with an evil alignment (changing only abilities that shift with the alignment change). A mirror duplicate can spend 3 actions in contact with the mirror to return to its original dimension and release the creature it duplicated, but most mirror duplicates prefer not to.
            Reset: The mirror is always ready to absorb creatures into the other dimension. Ten minutes after a creature is sucked into the mirror, if an ally doesn't rescue the creature with Thievery, it reaches the other dimension, where it might be captured or killed. In the mirror dimension, it counts as a mirror duplicate, so the denizens of the other dimension can't destroy the mirror on their side while the absorbed creature is there. These dimensions are alternate realities, not planes, so even spells like plane shift can't reach them.

            Trigger: Scream [reaction] Trigger Three or more living creatures remain within 100 feet of the trap for 6 seconds or longer. Effect The trap releases an arcane wail of the banshee (DC 40) with a 100-foot-radius emanation instead of 40 feet, targeting all living creatures in the area, and rolls initiative.
            Routine: Routine (1 action) The trap uses its action to force one random creature that failed its save against wail of the banshee last turn to emit a wail of the banshee with the same statistics as the initial one. The creature wails even if it is dead or unable to speak, no matter how far away from the trap it is. Unlike a casting of the spell, the drained condition from this trap’s wail of the banshee spells increases the targets’ drained condition values. A creature that critically succeeds at any of its saves can still be affected by the trap on future rounds, but can’t be forced to wail by the trap.
            Reset: The trap ends when the trap is unable to make a creature scream (usually because no creature failed its save on the previous turn or because all creatures have critically succeeded in the past). It then resets over 24 hours, as a new scream builds up in the mummified larynx.

Repulsive Refuse This flood has picked up tainted or disease-ridden objects like sewer runoff or rotting food. It deals 2d12+8 bludgeoning damage. Each creature exposed to the flood must attempt a DC 29 Fortitude save, becoming sickened 1 on a failure or sickened 2 on a critical failure. Additionally, creatures who come into contact with the flood waters are exposed to filth fever (DC 20 Fortitude). Sharp Debris The waters have picked up various objects, some of which are particularly sharp. The flood deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage and 1d12+12 piercing damage. Sticky Goo The substance is particularly sticky. It deals 2d12+6 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, each creature in the flood must attempt a DC 29 Reflex save at the beginning of their turn each round. On a failed saving throw, they take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all their Speeds for 1 round. On a critical failure, they are instead immobilized for 1 round.

            Trigger: Whirling Blade [reaction] Trigger Three or more creatures enter the area of the haunt; Effect sharp fragments lift up from the ground and begin to spin in rapid circles taking up one 5-foot square. The haunt rolls initiative.
            Routine: (3 actions) The tornado of blades uses 3 actions to move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing 2d10+10 slashing damage. Each creature in its path must attempt a DC 33 Reflex save. Each successful check to disable this hazard reduces the haunt’s movement by 30 feet, and the fourth success disables it completely.
            Critical Success: The creature is unaffected.
            Success: The creature takes half damage.
            Failure: The creature takes full damage plus 1d10 persistent bleed damage.

Each creature must attempt a DC 41 Will save, with the following effects.
            Critical Success: The creature is unaffected.
            Success: The creature is flat-footed and cannot use reactions. Additionally, it must spend 1 of its actions each round dancing. Dancing is a move action that allows the creature to Stride up to half its Speed.
            Failure: As success, except the creature must spend 2 of its actions each round dancing.
            Critical Failure: As failure, except the creature must spend 3 of its actions each round dancing.
            Routine: (1 action; auditory, enchantment, incapacitation, occult) The orchestra performs a raucous tune, compelling all creatures that can hear it to spend actions dancing. Each round, creature must attempt a DC 37 Will save; the results of this save modify the number of actions that the creature must spend dancing each round. If this would cause the creature to spend more actions dancing than it can use on its turn, the creature takes 10d6 damage (or double that on a critical failure) from moving faster than its body can manage.
            R_Critical Success: The creature decreases the number of actions it must spend dancing by 1.
            R_Success: No effect.
            R_Failure: The creature increases the actions it must spend dancing by 1.
            R_Critical Failure: The creature increases the actions it must spend dancing by 2.
            Reset: The eerie orchestra spends an hour retuning its phantasmal instruments, after which it is ready to begin its routine again.

The creature can use a free action, which has the concentrate trait, to choose any direction they wish for gravity to pull them. This allows a creature to Stride along any surface or Fly in a straight line by choosing a direction into midair. For unattended objects and mindless creatures, this is microgravity they float in place unless pushed off a surface.
            Routine: (1 action) Winds blow through the area in a random direction, causing creatures and objects within 50 feet of the air rift to float up, down, north, south, east, or west (roll a d6 to determine which direction). Creatures and objects in the area must attempt a DC 37 Fortitude save. If a creature is pushed into a solid object or another creature by this effect, both take 3d8+15 bludgeoning damage on impact.

Each creature that begins its turn in a frozen space takes 2d6+2 cold damage (DC 40 basic Reflex save). A creature that critically fails its save also becomes slowed 1 for 1 round; if it was already slowed, the creature instead becomes immobilized for 1 round.

            Trigger: Quake [reaction] Trigger Mogaru moves at least 60 feet; Effect The ground shakes in a 120-foot emanation from Mogaru's space. This creates a variety of effects, depending on where the player characters are at the time of the quake. In most parts of the city, the ground becomes difficult terrain, and creatures on it are clumsy 2 for 1 round. In parts of the city with existing underground spaces (like sewers, sinkholes, or catacombs), fissures open up in the ground. Creatures in the area tumble into the resulting 40-foot-deep hole unless they succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save. In bays, on beaches, and in other relatively substantial but shallow bodies of water, Mogaru's movement creates dangerous waves. Creatures in the water or within 60 feet of the waterline are struck by waves that deal 3d8 bludgeoning damage (DC 35 basic Reflex save). On a critically failed save, a creature is instantly swept 60 feet out to sea and 60 feet under the water's surface.

The DC of the flat check for this round (see Routine) is increased by 4 on a success, or by 8 on a critical success. Increasing the flat check DC to 21 or higher stabilizes the structure, ending this hazard.
            Trigger: Shake Apart [reaction] Trigger Mogaru applies any amount of force to the structure; Effect The building trembles. The floors of the building and the streets within 30 feet of the building become difficult terrain; creatures on this difficult terrain take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks. The hazard rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The GM rolls a DC 9 flat check to determine if the building collapses, increasing the DC as listed above. On a successful check, dust and debris fall within the building and 30 feet around it, providing concealment and dealing 6d6 bludgeoning damage to 1d4 randomly chosen targets (DC 35 basic Reflex save; on a critically failed save, the creature is knocked prone). On a critical success, the effect is the same, but the debris deals 12d6 bludgeoning damage to 2d4 randomly chosen targets instead (DC 35 basic Reflex save; on a critically failed Reflex save, the creature is restrained by rubble until freed [Force Open DC 38, Escape DC 35]).

            Trigger: Reflection of Evil [reaction] (arcane, conjuration, teleportation); Trigger A non-evil creature is reflected in the mirror; Effect The mirror absorbs the creature into the mirror, replacing it with an evil mirror duplicate (DC 41 Reflex to avoid being absorbed into the mirror), and rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The mirror absorbs another reflected creature into the mirror and replaces it with a mirror duplicate. Mirror duplicates attack on their own initiative, using the same statistics as the original creature, but with an evil alignment (changing only abilities that shift with the alignment change). A mirror duplicate can spend 3 actions in contact with the mirror to return to its original dimension and release the creature it duplicated, but most mirror duplicates prefer not to.
            Reset: The mirror is always ready to absorb creatures into the other dimension. Ten minutes after a creature is sucked into the mirror, if an ally doesn't rescue the creature with Thievery, it reaches the other dimension, where it might be captured or killed. In the mirror dimension, it counts as a mirror duplicate, so the denizens of the other dimension can't destroy the mirror on their side while the absorbed creature is there. These dimensions are alternate realities, not planes, so even rituals like plane shift can't reach them.

            Complexity: Complex
            Stealth: –10; initiative modifier is +5
            Description: A fire engulfs the western door and a 10-foot-by-10-foot area immediately east of it, then spreads on each of its turns.
            Disable_DC: Disable Eliminating the hazard requires dousing the flames. Water typically clears a 5-foot square if the amount is small (such as that from create water or hydraulic push). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A waterskin doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire. Cold can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is usually less effective than water, so a frost vial typically puts out 1 square of fire, and ray of frost is ineffective. Fountain Circle, located outside town hall, has several working water pumps. These are far enough away that it's impractical for a PC to bring water back and forth. However, a PC might instruct the more steely nerved spectators to create a bucket brigade. It takes 15 spectators (which can include those rescued by councilors as well as by PCs) to set this up, and 2 rounds for the townspeople to line up and begin pumping water from Fountain Circle. As of the 3rd round, there is a bucket of water available for the PCs to use at the chamber's southern entrance at the beginning of each PC's turn. Members of a bucket brigade are lined up outside the chamber, and don't take damage from smoke inhalation. If a PC does want to carry the water, it's 150 feet from the chamber's southern door to a pump, so it 6 actions are usually needed to reach the pumps or return. Filling a bucket requires an Interact action. Other methods might also help control the fire, as you determine. For example, the PCs might be able to find something to barricade the fire with to control its path, or use a cloak to beat out some of the fire.
            Routine: Routine On its turn, the fire spreads into a number of additional squares equal to half the number of squares the fire currently occupies, with a minimum of 1 square. You determine the squares the fire spreads into—typically those with the most flammable materials. Any creature that ends its turn next to the flames takes 1d6 fire damage, and any creature within the flames takes 4d6 fire damage. Both of these have a DC 17 basic Reflex save. A creature can take damage from flames only once per round. (For simplicity, track damage only for the NPCs and their allies, not for the spectators; Turn 5 and Turn 7 have instructions regarding the spectators' health). The fire has an additional effect on each of its turns after the first. Turn 2 The chamber's northern door flies open and flames burst through, igniting the 10-foot-by-10-foot area in front of the door. All fires spread on subsequent turns, at the same rate listed above. Any fires that join together become one fire for this purpose.Turn 4+ Creatures in the room take 1d6 damage from smoke inhalation at the ends of their turns. Anyone who uses an Interact action to tie a wet rag around their nose and mouth (or uses another creative solution) halves the damage. Turn 5 Spectators still inside the room fall unconscious from burns and smoke inhalation. Turn 7 Spectators still in the room die.

Critical Failure The target is controlled by the dragon pillar and remains within 60 feet of it at all times, defending the dragon pillar from all non-Cinderclaws. While a target is controlled, it is treated as a Cinderclaw ally by the dragon pillar. The dragon pillar can control up to 3 targets at a time; any targets in excess who critically fail this saving throw are instead confused for 1d4+1 rounds. A controlled creature can attempt a new Will save once every 24 hours to escape control, but doing so automatically causes the dragon pillar to attack it with a new eye beam to attempt to re-establish control. The control ends if the pillar is destroyed. Yellow Eye Beam (area A12) (electricity) 6d6 electricity damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save). Orange Eye Beam (area A15) (acid) 6d6 acid damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save). Red Eye Beam (area A16) (fire) 6d6 fire damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save).

            Description: Three bulky kegs of black powder placed at key locations in the temple are triggered to explode in unison, causing the entire structure to collapse into rubble and slide partially down the cliff face.
            Disable_DC: Disable No special skills are required to disable this manually activated trap. As an Interact action, a PC can sweep aside some black powder to interrupt the fuse line, but this doesn't prevent Gerhard from activating a keg via blunderbuss. A keg that is removed from its position (either by being thrown over the cliff or merely carried away) retains its explosive potential, but as long as one of the three kegs are removed they no longer have the precise placement required to trigger a collapse—an explosion at this point merely inflicts fire damage in the appropriate areas but does not particularly damage the temple structure itself. A keg's contents can be dispersed by scattering the gunpowder to the wind (most efficiently by pouring it over the cliff side) as a 2-action activity, or rendered permanently inert by pouring a gallon of water into the powder, inhibiting its explosive qualities. The kegs themselves can be destroyed with damage (note that the AC listed below for each keg takes into account the fact that Gerhard has wedged the kegs into nooks in the temple's stone flooring and walls), but note that any fire damage (including incidental fire damage from area effects like a fireball or Gerhard's blunderbuss) causes them to explode. At your option, other actions may be similarly effective at disabling this hazard.

Fire damage in overlapping areas isn't cumulative, but if all three kegs are in their initial positions when the explosion occurs, the temple itself collapses, causing 8d6 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the temple (DC 24 basic Reflex).

            Trigger: Opened Sluices [reaction] Trigger A creature Interacts to throw either the primary lever or backup lever. Effect The trap rolls initiative.
            Routine: (6 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled or destroyed sluice. On each of its actions, the water rushing from the sluices flows through the room, creating a river of churning water that fills the room to several inches and makes the floor of the chamber into difficult terrain. The water level never rises above this level in the room, as it drains out of the chutes to the south and begins to flood the quarry pit (area J2). On the trap's second turn, the water starts filling the four slave pits in area J2. Each of the trap's actions fills the pits 4 inches (2 feet per round if all sluices are functional). If the slave pits fill to their total depth of 12 feet and the grates over the slave pits aren't open, the slaves begin to drown, dying if they aren't freed in 5 rounds. Once the slave pits are full, the water continues to slowly fill the central area over the course of an hour until it empties the reservoir and floods area J2 to a depth of 15 feet. Other options beyond disabling or destroying the sluices could prevent the flooding of the quarry pit at your discretion.
            Reset: The trap resets if all six sluices are closed. If all the water has drained when this occurs, the water takes many months to refill.

            Trigger: Call to Nothingness [reaction] (auditory, divine, enchantment, mental, sonic) Trigger A living creature moves more than 10 feet into area A3; Effect The eerie call of the entropy choir saps the will of living creatures. A living creature who fails a DC 36 Will save becomes slowed 1 as long as they remain in area A3. The entropy choir then rolls initiative.
            Routine: (3 actions; auditory, divine, evocation, sonic) The choir continues to sing its grim dirge every round until it is disabled or destroyed. If there are any non-slowed living creatures in area A3 when its turn starts, it first uses Call to Nothingness as a single action. It uses its remaining actions (or all three actions if there are slowed living creatures in the room already) to focus soul-shattering choruses onto individual targets. The choir can target any living creature in area A3 with an action, but never more than once per round per creature. It prefers to attack slowed creatures over all others, but it targets non-slowed creatures if they're the only viable targets. A targeted creature must attempt a DC 36 Fortitude save.
            R_Critical Success: The target is unaffected.
            R_Success: The target takes 5d6 sonic damage.
            R_Failure: The target takes 10d6 sonic damage.
            R_Critical Failure: The target takes 15d6 sonic damage and increases their drained condition by 1, to a maximum of drained 4.
            Reset: The entropy choir resets automatically after 24 hours, even if it has been disabled or destroyed. It fades away forever once Dwandek and other members of the cult to which it sings its praises are destroyed.

Each round at the start of their turn, the creature takes 4d8 mental damage as they are assaulted by otherworldly visions, and must succeed at a new Will save against the original DC to be ejected from the pocket plane and deposited in the center of area A5.
            Reset: The deathly dream trap resets automatically as long as it hasn't been disabled or destroyed. Each time it resets, the tiny pocket plane of nightmare it sends its victim into resets as well, so no two victims will ever share the same deathly dream.

            Routine: (3 actions) With each action, the auto-turret makes a longrifle Strike against a creature within 60 feet of Tan-Takneh's campsite (other than Tan-Takneh). If there are no such creatures, the auto-turret instead uses its action to sprout mechanical legs, totter 20 feet in the direction of its last target, and then plant itself into the ground again. Programmed to spread its fire around, the auto-turret doesn't attack any creature it's already attacked in the round. After making 15 Strikes, the auto-turret depletes its ammunition and automatically deactivates.

            Description: Ebeshra brushes against a structure, possibly causing it to collapse.
            Disable_DC: Disable DC 43 Athletics (master), Crafting (master), or Engineering Lore (master) to brace the structure to reduce the risk of collapse until the end of the creature's next turn. The DC of the flat check for this round (see Routine) is increased by 4 on a success, or by 8 on a critical success. Increasing the flat check DC to 21 or higher stabilizes the structure, ending this hazard.
            Trigger: Shake Apart [reaction] Trigger Ebeshra applies any amount of force to the structure; Effect The building trembles. The floors of the building and the streets within 30 feet of the building become difficult terrain; creatures on this difficult terrain take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks. The hazard rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The GM rolls a DC 9 flat check to determine if the building partially collapses, increasing the DC as listed above. On a successful check, dust and debris fall within the building and 30 feet around it, providing concealment and dealing 6d6 bludgeoning damage to 1d4 randomly chosen targets (DC 35 basic Reflex save; on a critical failure, the creature is knocked prone). On a critical success, the effect is the same, but the debris deals 12d6 bludgeoning damage to 2d4 randomly chosen targets instead (DC 35 basic Reflex save; on a critical failure, the creature is restrained by rubble until freed [Force Open DC 38, Escape DC 35]).
            Reset: The building becomes susceptible to Shake Apart again 1d6 rounds after it's stabilized.

            Trigger: Fire Pin [reaction] Trigger A creature Ebeshra can see begins to use a teleportation effect or an effect that would move any number of targets to a different plane; Effect Ebeshra hurls a crystal at the triggering creature. The triggering creature and all creatures within 50 feet of the creature take 16d8 piercing damage (DC 45 basic Reflex save) and additional effects based on the result of their save.
            Critical Success: The creature is unaffected.
            Success: The effect is counteracted, and the creature can't use teleportation effects or planar travel effects for 1 minute.
            Failure: As success, but for 1 day instead of 1 minute.
            Critical Failure: As success, but for 1 week instead of 1 minute. Additionally, the creature becomes pinned under the crystal and must succeed at 3 total DC 45 checks to Escape from under the crystal.

            Stealth: +32 (master) to notice Ebeshra twisting its shape in preparation of creating a planar rift
            Description: Ebeshra opens a massive rift in the Material Plane that pulls nearby creatures into another plane entirely. The rift is typically to a random plane in the multiverse, though Ebeshra can have the rift pull creatures into a plane of Ebeshra's choosing. Additionally, Ebeshra can choose any number of creatures to be immune to the effects of the planar rift, usually due to the kaiju recognizing the innocence of the creatures.
            Disable_DC: DC 47 Lore (master) related to the specific plane beyond the rift to disrupt the planar frequency and close the rift, DC 52 Arcana (legendary) or Occultism (legendary) to undo the Magical manifestation of the rift, DC 55 Performance (legendary) to play a tone that counteracts the rift's harmonic frequency, or DC 55 Diplomacy (legendary) or Religion (legendary) to plead with Ebeshra to close the rift
            Trigger: Tear Reality [reaction] Trigger Ebeshra recognizes a nearby threat as needing an indisputable resolution, or a deity tasks Ebeshra with creating a planar rift; Effect Ebeshra twists its body, aligning its segmented sections into a fine blade, and cuts the fabric of the Material Plane. It creates an enormous rift in a point in the sky within 1 mile. The rift is 100 feet long and 50 feet wide. The hazard rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The rift pulls creatures within 500 feet toward it. The rift can pull any creature, regardless of its size. Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 45 Fortitude or Reflex save (the creature's choice) to resist the effects of this pull or attempt to grab something to avoid getting pulled. If a creature is directly beneath the rift when the rift pulls it, the creature instead attempts a DC 50 Fortitude or Reflex save (the creature's choice) to avoid being pulled into the rift. On a failure, the creature is pulled up into the rift and thrown to a random point on the plane on the other side.
            Critical Success: The creature resists the pull and doesn't move toward the rift.
            Success: The creature is moved 25 feet toward the rift.
            Failure: The creature is moved 50 feet toward the rift.
            Critical Failure: The creature is moved 100 feet toward the rift. The harsh pull causes the creature to take 10d6 bludgeoning damage.
            Reset: Ebeshra vanishes 1 minute after opening the rift, which closes the rift. Ebeshra must wait 1 week before it can open another planar rift.

            Trigger: Quake [reaction] Trigger Ebeshra moves at least 60 feet on land; Effect The ground shakes in a 120-foot emanation from Ebeshra's space. This creates a variety of effects depending on the surrounding environment. In an area without significant underground space, the ground becomes greater difficult terrain, and creatures on it are flat-footed and clumsy 2 for 1 round. In areas with existing underground spaces (like sewers, sinkholes, or catacombs), fissures open up in the ground. Creatures in the area tumble into the resulting 80-foot-deep hole unless they succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save. In bays, on beaches, and in other relatively substantial but shallow bodies of water, the tremors create dangerous waves. Creatures in the water or within 60 feet of the waterline are struck by waves that deal 10d8 bludgeoning damage (DC 35 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature is instantly swept 60 feet out to sea and 60 feet under the water's surface.
            Reset: Ebeshra doesn't rush this way again for 1d4 rounds.

            Trigger: Lightning Blast [reaction] Trigger A creature takes a hostile action against Ebeshra, produces a visible area effect, or flies within 120 feet of Ebeshra; Effect Ebeshra unleashes a 240-foot line of electricity toward the triggering creature. Creatures in the line take 16d8 electricity damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). The electricity creates a static field in all squares that the line passed through and all adjacent squares. For 1 round, any creatures that enter a space in the static field take 4d8 electricity damage (DC 38 basic Reflex save).

            Complexity: Complex
            Stealth: +16 (expert)
            Description: A whirlwind of four ephemeral, Magical threads dispels the undead and shrouds the living in an endless slumber.
            Disable_DC: DC 23 Religion (expert) or DC 21 Performance (trained) to dissipate one of the four threads. Characters who failed or critically failed a Performance check to participate in Grandfather Eiwa's funeral in Chapter 1 have been able to reflect on the experience; these characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their Performance checks to disable this trap. The trap is destroyed when all four threads are dissipated.
            Trigger: Breath of Pharasma [reaction] (divine, necromancy) Trigger A living or undead creature opens the trunk; Effect The ephemeral winds rise, sapping energy. All living and undead creatures within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become slowed 1 (slowed 2 on a critical failure). The trap then rolls initiative.
            Routine: (4 actions) Each thread of energy passes through a random living or undead creature within 60 feet, dealing 4d6 damage (DC 22 basic Will save) to the creature. A thread deals negative damage to living creatures and positive damage to undead creatures. Each thread passes through a different random creature, if possible. Each dissipated thread reduces the trap's number of actions by 1.
            Reset: The haunt deactivates 1 minute after no living or undead creatures are within 100 feet, then resets.

On a failed save, the triggering creature is immobilized (Escape DC 21). This collapse fully blocks the tunnel (area A2), making it impassable.

Tighten Grip [free-action] Trigger The Abyss-warped trees critically hit a creature with a branch Strike; Effect The Abyss-warped trees loop their branches around the triggering creature, grabbing it (Escape DC 21).
            Routine: (4 actions) The Abyss-warped trees use their first action each round to lash their roots; each creature in the tainted grove must succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save or fall prone. The Abyss-warped trees use their second, third, and fourth actions to make branch Strikes against up to three different creatures in the tainted grove. Melee branch +14, Damage 2d8+5 bludgeoning

            Description: A creature experiences the death of a priest carried off by griffons and fed to their chicks.
            Disable_DC: DC 22 Diplomacy (trained) to soothe the restless spirits, or DC 24 Religion (trained) to recite a prayer honoring the deceased; two successful checks are required to disable the haunt
            Trigger: Final Flight [reaction] (illusion, mental, occult) Trigger A creature enters the gathering circle; Effect The triggering creature experiences the last moments of the priest who once tended the Lea of Honored Souls. Griffons swoop down from the sky and snatch the priest up in their claws, dealing 1d8+7 slashing damage. They're carried southwest across the valley to a mountain peak and dropped into a nest of young griffons. As the chicks devour the priest, the character takes 1d8+7 piercing damage and 2d8 mental damage. The affected creature must then attempt a DC 22 Will save.
            Critical Success: The creature is unaffected.
            Success: The creature takes half damage from all damage dealt by the haunt.
            Failure: The creature takes full damage.
            Critical Failure: The creature takes full damage and can't shake off the vision; they take 1d8 persistent bleed damage and are frightened 1—believing they're being eaten alive—as long as the bleed damage persists.
            Reset: The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all living creatures leave the Lea of Honored Souls. Ten minutes after deactivating, the haunt resets.

            Source: Pathfinder 176 Lost Mammoth Valley Page 35
            Complexity: Complex
            Stealth: -10
            Description: A 10-foot-by-10-foot bonfire spreads to the surrounding forest on each of its turns.
            Disable_DC: Disable A successful DC 22 Athletics, Nature, or Survival check from an adjacent square is sufficient to smother one 5-foot-square of fire; each attempt is an Interact action. Dousing the flames automatically extinguishes one or more sections of fire, with no check. Water typically clears a 5-foot square if the amount is small (such as from a spell like create water or hydraulic push). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A waterskin doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire. Cold can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is less effective than water, so a frost vial puts out only 1 square of fire, and a ray of frost is ineffective.
            Trigger: Stoke Flames [reaction] Trigger A brimorak urges the fire to spread out of control; Effect The bonfire becomes a forest fire and rolls initiative.
            Routine: On its turn, the fire spreads into a number of additional squares equal to half the number of squares the fire currently occupies (minimum 1 square). You determine the squares the fire spreads into. Any creature that ends its turn next to the flames takes 2d8+5 fire damage, or 4d8+10 fire damage if it ended its turn within the flames (DC 25 basic Reflex save in either case). A creature can take damage from the forest fire only once per round.

            Description: Necromantic runes inscribed on the cage bars and lock drain the vitality of living creatures who interact with the cage.
            Disable_DC: Disable Thievery DC 25 (expert) to drain the runes power harmlessly or dispel magic (3rd level; counteract DC 22) to counteract the rune
            Trigger: Soul Drain [reaction] (arcane, necromancy, negative) Trigger A creature touches the cage bars, door, or lock directly or with a tool; Effect The trap deals 4d8+18 negative damage to the triggering creature, creatures inside the cage, and all creatures adjacent to the cage (DC 27 basic Fortitude save). On a failed save, a creature is also drained 1.

            Stealth: +30 (legendary) to distinguish between the hazard and the oozes within it; DC 0 to notice the pool
            Description: A shallow, foul-smelling puddle of toxic acid blocks a narrow hall, and poison bursts from it when disturbed.
            Disable_DC: DC 40 Crafting (master) or DC 42 Survival (legendary) to neutralize the acid while within reach of it. Three successes using either skill (or a combination of both) destroys the hazard. Deadly Footing The area of the venom pool is difficult terrain, and each creature moving through it takes 10 acid damage for every square of its area that it moves into.
            Trigger: Poison Puff [reaction] Trigger A creature moves through any square in the hazard's space; Effect The pool produces a 9th-level cloudkill (DC 40) at its center. It then rolls initiative.\
            Routine: (2 actions) The hazard uses its first action to spread 10 feet down the hallway in both directions. Once out of the hall, each side spreads in a random direction each round, but they don't go through doors. The hazard uses its second action to move the center of the cloudkill up to 20 feet in any direction to which any part of the pool has line of effect (normally, to encompass the greatest number of characters). If the cloudkill isn't present, it instead uses its second action to produce a new cloudkill, as Poison Puff.
            Reset: The hazard ends after 1 minute, contracting to its original size and keeping still until disturbed again.

            Trigger: Flame Spurt [reaction] Trigger A creature moves within 5 feet of the flue; Effect A fiery geyser of flaming gas explodes from the ground.

            Disable_DC: Survival DC 25 (expert) to disturb the surface and reveal the tar pit
            Trigger: Capture [reaction] Trigger A Huge or smaller creature walks onto the tar pit; Effect The triggering creature sinks into the tar pit up to its waist. The tar pit rolls initiative if it hasn't already.
            Routine: (1 action) On its initiative, the tar pit pulls down each creature within it, thick tar adhering to the creature's body. A creature that was submerged up to its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and must hold its breath to avoid suffocation. A creature in the tar pit can attempt a DC 33 Athletics check to Climb to either raise itself by one step (if it's submerged to its neck or full submerged) or to move 5 feet if it's submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. Other creatures can Aid the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid or by attempting to pull the creature out with their own DC 33 Athletics check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check. In addition to the usual results, a character adjacent to the tar pit who critically fails while Aiding moves into the tar pit. A creature that Climbs out of the tar pit escapes the hazard and lands prone in an adjacent space.
            Reset: Though the hazard still captures anyone who touches it, the surface doesn't become hidden again until it settles, which takes 24 hours.

            Disable_DC: two DC 32 Athletics or Diplomacy checks to douse the flames; Athletics to do the work yourself or Diplomacy to muster the ghostly soldiers. This reduces the hazard's actions by 1 and prevents it from using Burning Timbers.

When the hazard loses all 3 actions, Burning Timbers, and Demonic Abduction, it's disabled.

Burning Timbers [one-action] Creatures within the 30-foot by 90-foot area of the hall take 4d6+12 fire damage (DC 29 basic Reflex save). Demonic Abduction [one-action] Spectral demons lift a single creature 50 feet into the air and drop it. The haunt makes a Strike against the creature with a +23 attack bonus. On a success, the creature is lifted into the air and dropped, taking 25 bludgeoning damage, though it might negate some or all this damage using a spell, such as feather fall. On a critical hit, the creature also takes 2d12+13 slashing damage as the demons' claws tear through its flesh.
            Trigger: Burst of Fire [reaction] Trigger A creature enters the hall or ends its turn in the hall; Effect The hall bursts into flame, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each creature in the hall. The haunt then rolls initiative.
            Reset: The hall falls quiet for 24 hours, after which it can trigger again.

            Description: A phantom conductor appears with a flourish, causing spectral instruments with razor-like strings to appear in the hands of those present. As the conductor gestures for the performance to begin, creatures are compelled to play the instruments.
            Disable_DC: DC 18 Performance to perform so well the conductor releases you from your instrument, banishing it voluntarily; DC 22 Occultism or Religion (trained) to banish one instrument; or DC 25 Thievery (trained) to sabotage one instrument; each instrument must be banished, sabotaged, or destroyed to disable the haunt

            Failure: A conjured instrument appears in the creature's hands and it's compelled to play it (see routine below). The creature can't willingly put down the instrument while compelled to play.
            Critical Failure: As failure, but the creature needs a critical success on its Performance in order for the conductor to be satisfied and dismiss its instrument.
            Routine: (1 action; enchantment, mental, occult) The conductor urges each creature within 30 feet to play the hazardous instrument it holds. Each creature that is compelled to play its instrument does so, and those who succeeded on their save can choose to do so. Playing the instrument, either from the haunt's routine or of a creature's own volition during an attempt to disable the haunt, deals 1d6+3 slashing damage (DC 21 basic Reflex save), and the creature must attempt a DC 18 Performance check. On a success, the conductor accepts the performance and dismisses that creature's instrument, and on a critical failure, the discordant sound and conductor's jeers deal an additional 1d6+3 sonic damage.
            Reset: The haunt deactivates when all conjured instruments are destroyed or there has been silence for 1 minute. It resets after 1 hour.

            Routine: (3 actions) The spirit cyclone uses 3 actions to move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing 2d10+13 negative damage to each creature in its path (DC 32 basic Reflex save). A creature needs to attempt only one save during the cyclone's movement, even if the cyclone moves over its space more than once. On a critical failure, a creature is swept up into the cyclone, becoming grabbed (Escape DC 32). A creature grabbed by the cyclone moves along with the cyclone and takes 1d10+6 additional negative damage at their beginning of its turn, and it must attempt a Reflex save against the cyclone on the cyclone's turn, no matter where the cyclone moves. A creature that successfully Escapes from the cyclone falls from a height of 1d12 × 5 feet.

            Routine: (1 action) Each round on its initiative count, the trap pumps more sleeping gas into the room. Any breathing creature in the room is exposed to the toxin. If a creature acts before the trap on the first round, it has the option of holding its breath to postpone breathing in the poison—holding one's breath after the trap's first action has no effect, since the air in the creature's lungs is already tainted. The trap functions for 1 minute before all the gas is expended, after which it rapidly decays over the next minute. Opening the door to an adjacent room cuts the remaining time it takes for the gas to decay in half but exposes creatures in that room as well. Sleeping Gas (inhaled, poison) Saving Throw DC 22 Fortitude; Maximum Duration 4 hours; Stage 1 slowed 1 (1 round); Stage 2 unconscious with no Perception check to wake up (1 round); Stage 3 unconscious with no Perception check to wake up (1 hour)

            Critical Failure: As failure, but the creature becomes stupefied 2 instead. In addition, the creature continues to see dead, bloody bodies crawling from the ground during times of stress, causing them to treat all ground as difficult terrain during combat.

            Trigger: Hexed Calamity [reaction] Trigger A creature comes within 30 feet of the gremlin horde; Effect Every firearm within 30 feet misfires. If a creature is holding the firearm, they can attempt a DC 27 Will save, negating this effect on a success. The hazard rolls initiative.
            Routine: (3 actions; misfortune) The gremlin horde hurls one tinkering curse with each action, targeting an item within 60 feet wielded or worn by a creature. The creature must attempt a DC 27 Will save. The gremlin horde loses 1 action for each gremlin gang that's scattered.
            Critical Success: The hex bounces back to affect the gremlin horde. For 1 round, all creatures gain a +1 status bonus to checks to disable this hazard.
            Success: The item is unaffected.
            Failure: The item becomes unreliable for 1 round. If a creature attempts to Activate the item or Interact with it, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is wasted. If the item doesn't have an active use (such a mundane cloak), the creature wearing the item must instead immediately succeed at a DC 5 flat check or become tangled with the item and fall prone.
            Critical Failure: As failure, but the creature wielding or wearing the item also becomes clumsy 2.
            Reset: If not captured or killed, the scattered gremlin gangs regroup after 1d4 hours.

            Trigger: Confounding Misdirection [reaction] (arcane, illusion, mental) Trigger A creature passes through the rune-carved doorway or hallway; Effect The creature is confused by the illusions and directed back into the room they attempted to exit through another doorway or back to the hallway's beginning. This feels no different to the triggering creature than walking through the doorway or hallway, and onlookers are similarly befuddled. A creature who succeeds at a DC 19 Will save resists this illusion and exits the room or proceeds down the hall without being misdirected.

Each creature in the room while it's distorting must attempt a DC 17 Perception check.
            Critical Success: The creature disbelieves the illusions and is unaffected.
            Success: The creature disbelieves the illusions but still sees them. It treats the room as difficult terrain.
            Failure: The creature is fooled by the illusions. It treats the room as difficult terrain and becomes sickened 1. As long as it remains in the room, it can't reduce its sickened value below 1.

            Trigger: Downpour [reaction] Trigger A creature falls into the pool; Effect More water pours forth from the chalice. Creatures in the pool become clumsy 1, and they can't decrease their clumsy condition so long as they remain in the pool. The trap then rolls initiative.
            Routine: (3 actions) Water from the chalice increases the depth of the water by 10 feet for each action. Each time this happens, creatures in the pool are pushed 10 feet down and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. As the pool has no bottom, creatures in it can fall down indefinitely; they must Swim up to avoid drowning, but the water is especially choppy, so the Athletics DC is 25. The pool never overflows. Each successful check to Disable reduces the pool's actions by 1, and once the pool is completely Disabled, the water becomes still and the Athletics DC to Swim becomes 10.

            Stealth: +15 (expert)
            Description: Iron Taviah's cottage comes to life and tries to eat everyone in it. The hazard is divided into three areas the basement becomes the cottage's stomach; the stairs act as the cottage's throat, becoming a steep, slippery incline that is greater difficult terrain; and the ground floor is the inside of the cottage's mouth. Creatures within the cottage can move around within it but can't exit without pulling the mouth open or slipping out while its teeth gnash. Characters who successfully escape the cottage are safe from the hazard.
            Disable_DC: Disable The hungry cottage can't be damaged or disabled, but the danger in each area can be temporarily mitigated. In the stomach DC 17 Athletics (trained) to Climb atop the hoarded belongings and avoid contact with the acidic walls or floor for 1 round, or DC 25 Crafting (expert) as a 2-action activity to concoct an alchemical antacid that neutralizes acid damage dealt by the stomach for 1d4 rounds. In the throat DC 23 Athletics (trained) to hold the throat open for one round, allowing all characters in the stairs to use a Reflex save result one degree of success greater than their roll to avoid being pushed into the stomach, or DC 23 Nature or Survival as a 2-action activity to ease the throat's contractions and provide the same effect for 1d4 rounds. In the mouth DC 22 Athletics to Force Open a window or a door and forcibly expel one creature that's within 10 feet of an exit from the cottage, or DC 25 Athletics (expert) as a 2-action activity to jam furniture in place that prevents the teeth from gnashing for 1d4 rounds and allows anyone in the cottage to move from it during that time.
            Trigger: The Cottage Hungers [reaction] Trigger Iron Taviah is defeated in the cottage basement; Effect The basement floor absorbs Iron Taviah, and the cottage transforms into a hungry, semi-animate creature. The cottage rolls initiative.
            Routine: (3 actions) The cursed cottage uses 3 actions Acidic Assault in the stomach, Swallowing Staircase in the throat, and Gnashing Portal in the mouth (in that order). Checks to disable the areas might prevent these actions for a brief time. Acidic Assault [one-action] (acid) The walls and floor of the stomach steam with digestive juices; all creatures in contact with these surfaces take 2d8+4 acid damage (DC 24 basic Fortitude save). Gnashing Portal [one-action] Creatures on the cottage's main floor are ground down as massive teeth appear from the floor and ceiling, gnash, and recede into the architecture, dealing 2d8+4 bludgeoning damage. Creatures in this area must attempt a DC 24 Reflex save. Swallowing Staircase [one-action] Muscular swallowing contractions force creatures down the stairs and into the stomach. Creatures on the stairs must attempt a DC 24 Reflex save or be pushed 15 feet down the stairs (and across the basement floor with any excess forced movement if they're pushed to the bottom of the stairs). Creatures who critically fail this Reflex save fall prone at the end of this forced movement.
            Critical Success: The creature takes no damage and, if within 10 feet of an exit on the ground floor, can choose to exit the cottage.
            Success: The creature takes half damage and, if within 10 feet of an exit on the ground floor, can attempt to escape the cottage as the teeth retract by attempting a DC 24 Reflex save. On a success, the creature exits the cottage; on a critical failure, the creature falls prone.
            Failure: The creature takes full damage and is knocked prone.
            Critical Failure: The creature takes double damage, is knocked prone, and is stunned 1.
            Reset: Once no creatures remain in the cottage, the hazard resets and returns to a normal cottage. The stairs and the basement are gone, however, as is Iron Taviah's body.

Electrify [one-action] The metal vault crackles with electricity. In air, this would damage only creatures touching it; in water, the trap deals 2d8 electricity damage to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation (DC 25 basic Fortitude save). Launch Darts [one-action] The vault fires a stream of poisoned darts. The trap attacks all creatures in a 30-foot line with its poison dart spray Strike; roll 1d8 to determine the line's direction. These Strikes don't have a multiple attack penalty. Spin [one-action] The vault spins quickly for 1 round. While it Spins, checks to disable the trap have a –2 circumstance penalty, and it Launches Darts at all creatures within 30 feet of it, rather than in a line. Ranged [one-action] poison dart spray +18 (range increment 60 feet); Damage 4d4 piercing and 1d8 poison

            Routine: (2 actions) On its initiative, the trap uses its first action to spin, then stops. Roll 1d8 to determine which segment is topmost when the wheel stops spinning. The wheel uses its second action to replicate the spell listed for that segment (5th level, DC 27, spell attack roll +17). This spell's target is centered on or otherwise includes the nearest creature in the spell's area. This increases the spell's range to 30 feet if necessary. Any spell cast by this trap is occult. Spells black tentacles; blindness; confusion; death ward; outcast's curse; shadow blast (force damage in a 30-foot line); sound burst; spider climb

            Trigger: The Maze Awakens [reaction] Trigger A creature enters the maze; Effect Creatures in the maze can't escape it except by use of teleportation magic or as described in Trapped in the Maze. The trap rolls initiative. Trapped in the Maze Once each turn after it has taken a move action within the maze, each target in the maze can spend 1 action to attempt a DC 26 Perception or Survival check to escape it. A group traveling the maze together is treated as a single target; no more than one creature in the group can attempt this check each round, but accompanying creatures can Aid this check. The possible outcomes follow. A target attempting to leave the maze the same way it entered uses the outcome for one degree of success better than the result of its roll when attempting this check (failure to success, for example).
            Critical Success: The target escapes the maze.
            Success: The target is on the right path to the exit. If the target was already on the right path, it escapes the maze.
            Failure: The target makes no progress toward escape.
            Critical Failure: The target makes no progress toward escape, and if it was on the right path, it no longer is.
            Routine: (3 actions) The trap uses its first action to Magically shuffle the mirrors, rendering markings or maps of the maze ineffective. Creatures in the maze that fail a DC 26 Will save are stupefied 1 until they leave the maze. If the target fails additional saves against this ability, the condition value increases by 1 (to a maximum of stupefied 4). For its second action, the trap's ghostly minotaur attacks a random creature in the maze with its spectral gore. For its third action, the trap makes another spectral gore attack against a random creature. Melee [one-action] spectral gore +21, Damage 2d8+8 mental
            Reset: The trap deactivates and resets if 1 minute passes without any creature in the maze.

In addition, the cursed creature regains only half as many Hit Points as normal from all healing. The effect is permanent unless removed by magic.

            Trigger: Reflection of Evil [reaction] (arcane, conjuration, teleportation) Trigger A non-evil creature is reflected in the mirror; Effect The mirror absorbs the creature into the mirror, replacing it with an evil mirror duplicate (DC 42 Reflex to avoid being absorbed into the mirror), and rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The mirror absorbs another reflected creature into the mirror (DC 42 Reflex) and replaces it with a mirror duplicate. Mirror duplicates act on their own initiative, using the same statistics as the original creature, but with an evil alignment (changing only abilities that shift with the alignment change). Mirror duplicates are legendary in Intimidation and are permanently quickened, but they can use this additional action only to Demoralize. A mirror duplicate can spend 3 actions in contact with the mirror to return to its original dimension and release the creature it duplicated, but most mirror duplicates prefer not to.
            Reset: The mirror is always ready to absorb creatures into another dimension. 10 minutes after a creature is sucked into the mirror, if an ally doesn't rescue the creature using the Thievery skill, the creature reaches the mirror dimension, where it could be captured or killed. In the mirror dimension, it counts as a mirror duplicate, so the denizens of the other dimension can't destroy the mirror on their side while the absorbed creature is there. These dimensions are alternate realities, not planes, so even rituals like plane shift can't reach them.

            Routine: (3 actions) The convergence lattice uses its first action to call for aid. Each convergent creature within 100 feet of the lattice Strides toward the lattice as a reaction. Creatures thus called continue to move toward the lattice on their turn each round until they are adjacent to it, at which point they defend it with their lives. The lattice uses its second action to deal 16d6 mental damage (DC 42 basic Will save) to a non-convergent creature within 100 feet. This damage is nonlethal; a creature knocked out by this damage doesn't gain the dying condition and is automatically controlled by the convergence lattice when they awaken. The lattice uses its third action to make the same attack against a second non-convergent creature within 100 feet; if there isn't such a second creature, it doesn't take its third action.
            Reset: The convergence lattice deactivates and resets after there are no uncontrolled targets within line of sight for 1 minute.

Effect A pulse of electricity discharges from the lodestone to strike all four doors, with smaller arcs of electricity lancing out to strike all creatures in the room. The south and east doors slam shut, while the north and west doors fly open, releasing two vargouilles into the room. All creatures in the room take 2d6 electricity damage (DC 18 basic Reflex save). The trap then rolls initiative.
            Routine (1 action) On its initiative, the trap exerts a strong magnetic pull on the doors, causing the north and west doors to open if they're closed, or causing the south and east doors to close if they're open. A character can open or close a door against this pull with a successful DC 18 Athletics check to Force Open the door. At the same time, any character in the room who wears primarily metal armor must attempt a DC 18 Reflex save (characters in medium metal armor suffer a –1 circumstance penalty to this save, and characters in heavy metal armor suffer a –2 circumstance penalty).
            R_Critical Success: The PC is unaffected.
            R_Success: The PC resists the pull but treats the room as difficult terrain.
            R_Failure: The PC treats the room as difficult terrain and is knocked prone. A PC who's already prone suffers a critical failure instead.
            R_Critical Failure: As failure, but the PC is also pulled 5 feet toward the lodestone. A PC who is adjacent to the lodestone instead becomes stuck to it and is restrained as long as the trap continues its routine (Escape DC 18).
            Reset: At the end of a round in which there are no creatures standing on the floor or stuck to the lodestone, the trap deactivates. The vargouilles return to their alcoves, and the doors close. The trap resets automatically after 1 minute.

            Disable_DC: Disable This hazard can't be disabled, merely avoided.
            Trigger: Pitfall [reaction] Trigger A creature walks into a large pit's square; Effect The triggering creature falls into the pit but can attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to Grab an Edge to avoid falling. On a failure, a creature falls 20 feet into an eye-filled pit. The eyes cushion the fall so the 20-foot fall inflicts only 5 bludgeoning damage, but they also completely obscure vision; a character is effectively blind as long as they remain in the pit. The walls of the pit are slick, though a character can Climb them with a successful DC 25 Athletics check. Trip [reaction] Trigger A creature walks into a small pit's square; Effect The triggering creature must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save or fall prone (on a critical failure, the creature also twists its ankle and becomes clumsy 1 until it receives any amount of healing).

All creatures in this area must attempt a DC 21 Reflex save.
            Critical Success: The creature lurches to the side and takes no damage—move the creature to a square of the creature's choice adjacent to the trap's area of effect.
            Success: The creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed into an adjacent square just outside the trap's area.
            Failure: The creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage, is pushed into an adjacent square just outside the trap's area, and falls prone in that square.
            Critical Failure: The creature takes 12d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. The heavy doors pin the creature to the ground, Immobilizing it (Escape DC 22).

            Trigger: Invite Toil [reaction] Trigger A living creature enters the pit; Effect The surrounding dwarven shapes begin to chant in Dwarven, encouraging newcomers to join them as they grasp for them with their cold, incorporeal hands. The pit of toil rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action; divine, necromancy) As the dwarves continue to chant and grasp at the living, the pit infuses all living creatures inside it with the ache and pain a body endures after hours of constant toil. Each living creature in the pit must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save.

            Trigger: Spew Toxins [reaction] Trigger A visible living creature enters the room, or a Stealthy creature fails to remain hidden from the toxic furnace with a DC 25 Stealth check (the trap's sensors have darkvision and lifesense); Effect One of the toxic furnace's vents swivels to aim at the triggering creature and then spews a gout of boiling toxin at the target. The toxic furnace then rolls initiative.
            Routine: (3 actions) The trap loses 1 action for each disabled vent. On each of the trap's actions, a vent spews a gout of boiling toxin at a living creature in sight of it. It can't target a single creature more than once per round, so if there aren't enough viable targets for all 3 actions, the trap loses those unspent actions. Ranged boiling toxin +17 (range 30 feet), Damage 1d6 acid, 2d6 fire, and 2d6 poison

            Trigger: Manifest Crystal Sphere [reaction] Trigger Three or more creatures remain in the Outer Ring for 6 seconds or longer; Effect Six spheres of crystal, each measuring 2 feet in diameter, manifest from thin air and begin quickly floating toward intruders. A sphere manifests at each of the points on the map indicated with a small numeral (labeled 1 through 6); the trap then rolls initiative.
            Routine: (6 actions) On each of the trap's actions, a crystal sphere that hasn't yet taken an action during the turn either flies 25 feet toward the closest creature in the Outer Ring (if no creature is within 25 feet), or it attacks a visible creature within 25 feet (the crystal spheres can sense targets via darkvision). If a crystal sphere attacks a target, that target takes 1d6 force damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save) as the sphere hits them and bursts. A creature can be attacked by multiple spheres in a turn, but a sphere always targets the closest target. Once a sphere attacks and bursts, it vanishes but respawns at its spawn point at the start of the next turn and continues its routine. A sphere that has been destroyed or had its spawn point disabled vanishes and doesn't continue to respawn and attack, and the trap loses 1 action for each sphere destroyed or disabled in this way.

            Disable_DC: Thievery DC 28 (expert) to disable the main pressure plate at area H4a and deactivate the trap entirely (this causes the obsidian walls to retract up into the ceiling as well), Thievery DC 25 (trained) to disable one of the three lava spouts, or Athletics DC 28 (trained) to Force Open a fallen obsidian wall

            Trigger: Drop the Wall [reaction] Trigger Four or more Small or larger creatures walk onto the pressure plate at area H4a; Effect A magically hardened sheet of obsidian drops down like a portcullis in the western and northern entrances to this room that lead to areas H3 and H5, respectively. Any creatures standing in one of these squares takes 4d6+4 bludgeoning damage from the falling wall (DC 24 basic Reflex save) and then decides what side of the wall they want to be on. At the same moment, four thoqquas that have spent centuries in hibernation awaken and emerge from vents into area H4b. The trap then rolls initiative, as do the thoqquas.
            Routine: (3 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled spout each turn. On each action, a different spout located at one of the three areas marked H4c spews a gout of lava at the closest non-thoqqua target in its line of sight; these spouts use magical sensors that have darkvision and a Perception DC of 25. Originally, agents of the abbot would come through here after the trap was triggered, deactivate it, and clean out the hardened blobs of lava and dead bodies that remained, but the amount of time it would take for this trap to clog tunnels with cooled lava makes tracking that slow accretion over the course of this adventure unnecessary. Ranged [one-action] lava gout +17 (fire), Damage 4d8 fire; no multiple attack penalty
            Reset: The Last Crucible deactivates and resets 10 minutes after it has no target creatures (because the creatures either left area H4 or died). Any thoqquas that still live sense the magma river at area H6 and eventually make their way north to that area to swim away.

            Trait:
              - Magical
              - Trap
            Source: Pathfinder 184 The Ghouls Hunger Page 47
            Complexity: Complex
            Stealth: +28 (master)
            Description: The stink of bile suddenly grows as the myriad mouths carved into the walls begin to vomit forth a deluge of acidic slurry.
            Disable_DC: Disable DC 33 Thievery (master) to disrupt the trap's magical network of sensors and effectively “blind” it to targets to react to, DC 38 Religion (master) to recognize the carvings and recall one of the mantras needed to pass safely, or dispel magic (7th level; counteract DC 32) to counteract the trap.
            Trigger: Vomit [reaction] Trigger The trap's sensors notice a creature on the stairs north of the entrance to area D4; Effect The myriad mouths on the walls spew out a foul-smelling acidic slurry along the entire stairwell. The stairs in areas D3 become difficult terrain, and all creatures in area D3 must attempt a DC 34 Reflex saving throw. A creature that is fatigued by hunger takes a –2 circumstance penalty to this saving throw. The trap then rolls initiative.
            Critical Success: The creature is unaffected.
            Success: The creature takes 4d6 acid damage and is sickened 1.
            Failure: The creature takes 8d6 acid damage, is sickened 2, and is knocked prone.
            Critical Failure: The creature takes 16d6 acid damage, is sickened 3, is knocked prone, and then tumbles down the stairs. The fall ends once the creature reaches the next lowest landing (note that a creature falling at the lowest flight tumbles into the carrion pit at area D2, but can attempt to Grab an Edge as detailed in that room). A creature that falls down the steps takes an additional 4d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 32 basic Reflex save) from the tumble, regardless of the total distance traveled.
            Routine: (1 action) On its turn, the trap Vomits as its action. As long as the Putrid Rise is active, the stairs in area D3 are difficult terrain.
            Reset: The trap deactivates 1 round after no targets can be sensed, but resets immediately.

            Trigger: Negative Energy Pulse [reaction] (attack) Trigger A living creature enters the circular portion of area D4, or a crystal takes damage from any source; Effect The void garden creates a pulse of negative energy that fills the entire room and, if the doors to area D3 are open, extends 30 feet into the hallway beyond. All living creatures in this area must attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save. The trap then rolls initiative.
            Critical Success: The creature is unaffected
            Success: The creature takes 5d6 negative damage.
            Failure: The creature takes 8d6 negative damage and is drained 1.
            Critical Failure: The creature takes 16d6 negative damage and is drained 2.
            Routine: (6 actions) The void garden's crystals each use an action to fire a void ray, a beam of destructive dark purple energy, at a random living creature in the room or in visible reach through the open doorway (the crystals don't fire at living targets on the balcony in area D6c). A single creature can be targeted only once per round by a void ray. The void garden loses one action for each crystal that is disarmed or destroyed. Ranged [one-action] void ray +29 (negative, range 120 feet), Damage 3d10 negative plus drained 1 (this drained value stacks with that caused by other void rays or the hazard's Negative Energy Pulse, to a maximum of drained 5).
            Reset: The void garden deactivates 1 round after all living targets leave the area but resets immediately thereafter.

            Trigger: Collapse [reaction] Trigger A Small or larger creature moves more than 20 feet onto the bridge; Effect The bridge chains detach from their connectors, dropping itself and anything on it into the lake 150 feet below. A creature that's adjacent to the ledges to the north or south can attempt a DC 33 Reflex save to Grab the Edge, but creatures who can't reach the edge fall with the bridge into the toxic water below (unless one side of the bridge remains attached, in which case a creature can attempt to Grab an Edge by clinging to the dangling bridge—requiring a successful DC 20 Athletics check to climb the hanging bridge to safety).

            Description: Horrific visions of a lumbering monstrosity whose face is nothing but a fanged mouth lurch out of the violet mist to attempt to eat the viewer alive.
            Disable_DC: DC 42 Thievery (master) to focus the portal's energies back in on itself to close it off, or DC 36 Occultism (master) to invoke the proper chant and make the proper hand gestures to untether the portal from the Dreamlands, or dispel magic (8th level; counteract DC 34) to counteract the portal for 1 minute and prevent Orgesh's influence from reaching through during that time

            Stats: Hardness 26, HP 104 (BT 52); Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
            Trigger: Dreadful Vision [reaction] (illusion, mental, occult) Trigger At the start of a round after a creature who can dream and isn't immune to sleep effects enters the room, the portal starts to glow with purple mist. At this point, the portal triggers as soon as such a creature looks into it. A character who just passes by and doesn't specifically avert their gaze must attempt a DC 11 flat check to not accidently glance into the portal, while a character who Searches this room automatically looks into it unless they specify otherwise. Effect The nightmare portal casts phantasmal calamity (heightened to 8th level, Will save DC 37), making reality appear to crumble away to reveal a vast cavern filled with bones through which immense wormlike creatures burrow as they endlessly eat away at the world. The trap then rolls initiative.
            Routine: (2 actions) A vision of an immense lumbering figure with nothing but a circular mouth for a face lurches out of the portal. For each action, the nightmare portal casts phantasmal killer (heightened to 8th level, Will save DC 37), targeting a different creature both times. It can select targets in area E11, the secret alcove to the northeast, or up to 10 feet east from the door (although a closed door blocks it), choosing the closest two targets each round. The nightmare portal loses 1 action if it's broken and can thus only cast phantasmal killer once per round.
            Reset: The nightmare portal resets 1 minute after it no longer detects targets.

All creatures within 60 feet of the Spiral Seal must attempt a DC 41 Fortitude save.
            Critical Success: The creature is unaffected.

A creature can only be targeted once per round by the despairing breath, so if fewer than four creatures are in the room, the trap won't be able to take full advantage of all four of its actions. Ranged despairing breath +17 (fear, mental), Damage 2d8+7 mental damage; no multiple attack penalty. A creature damaged by the despairing breath must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become frightened 1 (or fleeing 1 on a critical failure); this effect has the fear trait.
            Reset: The trap resets after 1 minute.
