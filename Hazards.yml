            Complexity: Simple
            Stealth: DC 10 or detect magic
            Description: A roiling red orb, forged from a drop of the god Rovagug’s blood, rains fire from the sky when a specified condition is met.
            Disable_DC: Thievery DC 48 (legendary) to imbue thieves’ tools with aspects representing Asmodeus and Sarenrae and use them to drain away the orb’s power over 10 minutes; the character attempting this check takes 5 fire damage each round until the orb is depleted
            Trigger: Burn It All [reaction] (death, divine, evocation, fire); Trigger A special condition set by the trap’s creator occurs; this is typically the event of their death. Effect Fire rains from the sky in a 100-mile radius, dealing 10d6 fire damage to creatures and objects in the area. Each creature or object can attempt a DC 46 basic Reflex save. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly. This is not enough damage to completely burn away a forest or level an entire mountain or city, but it typically kills most creatures in the area.

            Complexity: Complex
            Stealth: +7 (trained)
            Description: A cloud of invisible magical sensors in a 10-foot radius surrounds an invisible wall or floor rune the size of the creature to be summoned.
            Disable_DC: Acrobatics DC 15 to approach without triggering the trap followed by Thievery DC 17 (trained) to erase the rune, or dispel magic (1st level; counteract DC 15) to counteract the rune
            Trigger: Summon Monster [reaction] (arcane, conjuration, summon); Trigger A creature enters the cloud of magical sensors. Effect This trap summons a specific level 1 creature, determined when the trap is created. The creature rolls initiative and remains for 2d6 rounds, after which the spell ends and the creature disappears. The creature also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The summoned creature can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.
            Reset: The trap resets each day at dawn
            Upgrade: You can make a summoning rune of nearly any level. It summons a creature of a level equal to the trap’s level. Use Table 10–5 DCs by Level on page 503 to determine the Thievery DC and spell DC, using the trap’s level and applying a hard adjustment (+2). The Stealth modifier for the trap is equal to this number – 10. Stronger summoning runes usually require expert proficiency or better in Perception to find, and they might require a higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable.

            Description: A trapdoor covers a 10-foot-square pit that’s 30 feet deep and has 5 feet of water at the bottom. Four water spouts in the walls connect to hidden water tanks. Each water spout extends out of a different wall, 6 inches from the top of the pit.

            Trigger: Pitfall [reaction] Trigger A creature walks onto the trapdoor. Effect The triggering creature falls in and takes damage from the fall, reduced by 5 feet for falling into the water (typically 12 bludgeoning damage). A creature can Grab an Edge to avoid falling. The trapdoor then slams shut, and the hazard rolls initiative.
            Routine: (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn for each disabled water spout. On each of the trap’s actions, a spout pours water, increasing the depth of the water by 5 feet. Once the pit is full of water, the pit stops using actions, but creatures in the pit begin drowning.
            Reset: The trap can be reset if the door is manually reengaged and the water tanks refilled; it can be reset without draining the pit, but doing so renders it less effective.

            Stealth: +12 (trained) (or –10 and no minimum proficiency if the surface is disturbed)
            Description: A 15-foot-wide patch of water and sand attempts to submerge creatures that step onto it.
            Disable_DC: Survival DC 18 (trained) to disturb the surface
            Trigger: Submerge [free-action] Trigger A Huge or smaller creature walks onto the quicksand. Effect The triggering creature sinks into the quicksand up to its waist. The quicksand rolls initiative if it hasn’t already.
            Routine: Routine (1 action) On its initiative, the quicksand pulls down each creature within it. A creature that was submerged up to its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and has to hold its breath to avoid suffocation. A creature in the quicksand can attempt a DC 20 Athletics check to Swim to either raise itself by one step if it’s submerged to its neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if it’s submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. A creature that Swims out of the quicksand escapes the hazard and is prone in a space adjacent to the quicksand patch. Other creatures can Aid the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own DC 20 Athletics check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check.
            Reset: The hazard still submerges anyone who walks in, but the surface doesn’t become hidden again until it settles over the course of 24 hours.

            Disable_DC: Thievery DC 21 (trained) twice on the pillar, or Thievery DC 19 (expert) once on the control panel deactivates the whole trap. Breaking the control panel prevents anyone from disabling the trap using the control panel and prevents the trap from deactivating automatically (see Reset below).

            Trigger: Rising Pillar [reaction] (attack); Trigger A creature steps on one of the trapped floor tiles. Effect The trap pops up in a grid intersection and makes a spinning blade attack against one adjacent creature (if any), then rolls initiative.
            Routine: Routine (3 actions) The trap uses its first action to make a spinning blade Strike against each adjacent creature, its second action to move straight in a random direction (roll 1d4 to determine the direction), and its third action to make a spinning blade Strike against each adjacent creature. This trap doesn’t take a multiple attack penalty. Speed 10 feet Melee [one-action] spinning blade +12, Damage 2d10+5 slashing

            Trigger: Wheel Spin [reaction] Trigger A creature enters the sensor’s detection area. Effect The wheel begins to spin and rolls initiative.
            Routine: Routine (2 actions) On its initiative, the trap uses its first action to spin, then stops. Roll 1d6 to determine which segment is topmost when the wheel stops spinning. The wheel uses its second action to replicate the spell listed for that segment (3rd level, DC 24, spell attack roll +14). This spell’s target is centered on or otherwise includes the nearest creature in the area. This increases the spell’s range to 100 feet if necessary. Any spell cast by this trap is arcane. Spells are sleep, paralyze, lightning bolt (100-foot line), blindness, acid arrow, ray of enfeeblement.
            Reset: The trap deactivates and resets if 1 minute passes without any creature moving within range of its sensor.

            Routine: Routine (1 action) The trap launches one dart against every creature in the gallery as 1 action. Because it launches darts continuously, the trap can also use the Continuous Barrage free action (see below) to launch darts at each creature during that creature’s turn. Ranged poisoned dart +21, Damage 3d4 piercing plus flesset poison; no multiple attack penalty Continuous Barrage [free-action] Trigger A creature within the active gallery finishes an action.

            Description: Four gated channels carved into stone allow lava to flow into a 15-foot-tall room; the floor can withdraw to allow the hardened lava to fall into a chamber beneath.

            Trigger: Flume Activation [reaction] Trigger A creature tries to leave the room. Effect The exits seal instantly and the trap rolls initiative.
            Routine: Routine (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled channel each turn. On each action, a different channel spews lava, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each creature within 10 feet of the channel (DC 27 basic Reflex save), and increasing the depth of the lava in the room by 1 foot (4 feet per round if all the channels are active). A creature that starts its turn in lava takes 8d6 fire damage and is immobilized until it Escapes the hardening lava (DC 27). The creature might suffocate if covered in lava. Lava from the previous round hardens fully at the start of the trap’s turn, effectively raising the floor of the room. Once the room is full of lava, the trap stops taking actions, but creatures in the room remain stuck until the floor opens and the trap resets.
            Reset: The trap deactivates and resets after 1 hour by withdrawing the floor, cracking and dumping the hardened lava (and any creatures trapped inside) into the chamber. Creatures fall 40 feet, taking falling damage (typically 17 bludgeoning damage).

            Stats: Hardness 22, HP 88 (BT 44) per telekinetic cloud
            Trigger: Agitate [reaction] (arcane, evocation); Trigger A creature stays in the room for at least 6 seconds. Effect Each telekinetic decoration constructs a cloud of objects in the room (three clouds total) and the trap rolls initiative. The creatures in the room when the trap is triggered become the trap’s targets, regardless of whether they leave the room or other creatures later enter the room. Each decoration targets a different creature if possible. A target creature that moves at least 1 mile from the trap ceases being a target, at which point the decoration designates a new target.
            Routine: Routine (9 actions) Each decoration uses 3 of the trap’s actions each turn, and the trap loses 3 actions each turn for every decoration that is disabled. A decoration uses its first action to move its cloud of objects up to 200 feet, its second action to make the objects Strike, and its third action to add more objects to the cloud, increasing its damage by 1d12 (to a maximum of 4d12+10). If a decoration’s cloud is already at maximum damage, it does nothing with its third action. If a decoration’s cloud has been destroyed, the decoration instead spends its first action to create a new cloud of objects inside the room (using the starting damage value) and then its second and third actions to have the cloud move and attack. Melee [one-action] objects +24, Damage 2d12+10 bludgeoning
            Reset: The trap deactivates and resets 10 minutes after it has no target creatures (because the creatures either moved too far away or died).

            Trigger: Reflection of Evil [reaction] (arcane, conjuration, teleportation); Trigger A non-evil creature is reflected in the mirror. Effect The mirror absorbs the creature into the mirror, replacing it with an evil mirror duplicate (DC 34 Reflex to avoid being absorbed into the mirror), and rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The mirror absorbs another reflected creature into the mirror and replaces it with a mirror duplicate. Mirror duplicates attack on their own initiative, using the same statistics as the original creature, but with an evil alignment (changing only abilities that shift with the alignment change). A mirror duplicate can spend 3 actions in contact with the mirror to return to its original dimension and release the creature it duplicated, but most mirror duplicates prefer not to.
            Reset: The mirror is always ready to absorb creatures into the other dimension. Ten minutes after a creature is sucked into the mirror, if an ally doesn't rescue the creature with Thievery, it reaches the other dimension, where it might be captured or killed. In the mirror dimension, it counts as a mirror duplicate, so the denizens of the other dimension can't destroy the mirror on their side while the absorbed creature is there. These dimensions are alternate realities, not planes, so even spells like plane shift can't reach them.

            Trigger: Scream [reaction] Trigger Three or more living creatures remain within 100 feet of the trap for 6 seconds or longer. Effect The trap releases an arcane wail of the banshee (DC 40) with a 100-foot-radius emanation instead of 40 feet, targeting all living creatures in the area, and rolls initiative.
            Routine: Routine (1 action) The trap uses its action to force one random creature that failed its save against wail of the banshee last turn to emit a wail of the banshee with the same statistics as the initial one. The creature wails even if it is dead or unable to speak, no matter how far away from the trap it is. Unlike a casting of the spell, the drained condition from this trap’s wail of the banshee spells increases the targets’ drained condition values. A creature that critically succeeds at any of its saves can still be affected by the trap on future rounds, but can’t be forced to wail by the trap.
            Reset: The trap ends when the trap is unable to make a creature scream (usually because no creature failed its save on the previous turn or because all creatures have critically succeeded in the past). It then resets over 24 hours, as a new scream builds up in the mummified larynx.

Repulsive Refuse This flood has picked up tainted or disease-ridden objects like sewer runoff or rotting food. It deals 2d12+8 bludgeoning damage. Each creature exposed to the flood must attempt a DC 29 Fortitude save, becoming sickened 1 on a failure or sickened 2 on a critical failure. Additionally, creatures who come into contact with the flood waters are exposed to filth fever (DC 20 Fortitude). Sharp Debris The waters have picked up various objects, some of which are particularly sharp. The flood deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage and 1d12+12 piercing damage. Sticky Goo The substance is particularly sticky. It deals 2d12+6 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, each creature in the flood must attempt a DC 29 Reflex save at the beginning of their turn each round. On a failed saving throw, they take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all their Speeds for 1 round. On a critical failure, they are instead immobilized for 1 round.

            Trigger: Whirling Blade [reaction] Trigger Three or more creatures enter the area of the haunt; Effect sharp fragments lift up from the ground and begin to spin in rapid circles taking up one 5-foot square. The haunt rolls initiative.
            Routine: (3 actions) The tornado of blades uses 3 actions to move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing 2d10+10 slashing damage. Each creature in its path must attempt a DC 33 Reflex save. Each successful check to disable this hazard reduces the haunt’s movement by 30 feet, and the fourth success disables it completely.
            Critical Success: The creature is unaffected.
            Success: The creature takes half damage.
            Failure: The creature takes full damage plus 1d10 persistent bleed damage.

Each creature must attempt a DC 41 Will save, with the following effects.
            Critical Success: The creature is unaffected.
            Success: The creature is flat-footed and cannot use reactions. Additionally, it must spend 1 of its actions each round dancing. Dancing is a move action that allows the creature to Stride up to half its Speed.
            Failure: As success, except the creature must spend 2 of its actions each round dancing.
            Critical Failure: As failure, except the creature must spend 3 of its actions each round dancing.
            Routine: (1 action; auditory, enchantment, incapacitation, occult) The orchestra performs a raucous tune, compelling all creatures that can hear it to spend actions dancing. Each round, creature must attempt a DC 37 Will save; the results of this save modify the number of actions that the creature must spend dancing each round. If this would cause the creature to spend more actions dancing than it can use on its turn, the creature takes 10d6 damage (or double that on a critical failure) from moving faster than its body can manage.
            R_Critical Success: The creature decreases the number of actions it must spend dancing by 1.
            R_Success: No effect.
            R_Failure: The creature increases the actions it must spend dancing by 1.
            R_Critical Failure: The creature increases the actions it must spend dancing by 2.
            Reset: The eerie orchestra spends an hour retuning its phantasmal instruments, after which it is ready to begin its routine again.

The creature can use a free action, which has the concentrate trait, to choose any direction they wish for gravity to pull them. This allows a creature to Stride along any surface or Fly in a straight line by choosing a direction into midair. For unattended objects and mindless creatures, this is microgravity they float in place unless pushed off a surface.
            Routine: (1 action) Winds blow through the area in a random direction, causing creatures and objects within 50 feet of the air rift to float up, down, north, south, east, or west (roll a d6 to determine which direction).

Each creature that begins its turn in a frozen space takes 2d6+2 cold damage (DC 40 basic Reflex save). A creature that critically fails its save also becomes slowed 1 for 1 round; if it was already slowed, the creature instead becomes immobilized for 1 round.

            Trigger: Quake [reaction] Trigger Mogaru moves at least 60 feet; Effect The ground shakes in a 120-foot emanation from Mogaru's space. This creates a variety of effects, depending on where the player characters are at the time of the quake. In most parts of the city, the ground becomes difficult terrain, and creatures on it are clumsy 2 for 1 round. In parts of the city with existing underground spaces (like sewers, sinkholes, or catacombs), fissures open up in the ground. Creatures in the area tumble into the resulting 40-foot-deep hole unless they succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save. In bays, on beaches, and in other relatively substantial but shallow bodies of water, Mogaru's movement creates dangerous waves. Creatures in the water or within 60 feet of the waterline are struck by waves that deal 3d8 bludgeoning damage (DC 35 basic Reflex save). On a critically failed save, a creature is instantly swept 60 feet out to sea and 60 feet under the water's surface.

The DC of the flat check for this round (see Routine) is increased by 4 on a success, or by 8 on a critical success. Increasing the flat check DC to 21 or higher stabilizes the structure, ending this hazard.
            Trigger: Shake Apart [reaction] Trigger Mogaru applies any amount of force to the structure; Effect The building trembles. The floors of the building and the streets within 30 feet of the building become difficult terrain; creatures on this difficult terrain take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks. The hazard rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The GM rolls a DC 9 flat check to determine if the building collapses, increasing the DC as listed above. On a successful check, dust and debris fall within the building and 30 feet around it, providing concealment and dealing 6d6 bludgeoning damage to 1d4 randomly chosen targets (DC 35 basic Reflex save; on a critically failed save, the creature is knocked prone). On a critical success, the effect is the same, but the debris deals 12d6 bludgeoning damage to 2d4 randomly chosen targets instead (DC 35 basic Reflex save; on a critically failed Reflex save, the creature is restrained by rubble until freed [Force Open DC 38, Escape DC 35]).

            Trigger: Reflection of Evil [reaction] (arcane, conjuration, teleportation); Trigger A non-evil creature is reflected in the mirror; Effect The mirror absorbs the creature into the mirror, replacing it with an evil mirror duplicate (DC 41 Reflex to avoid being absorbed into the mirror), and rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The mirror absorbs another reflected creature into the mirror and replaces it with a mirror duplicate. Mirror duplicates attack on their own initiative, using the same statistics as the original creature, but with an evil alignment (changing only abilities that shift with the alignment change). A mirror duplicate can spend 3 actions in contact with the mirror to return to its original dimension and release the creature it duplicated, but most mirror duplicates prefer not to.
            Reset: The mirror is always ready to absorb creatures into the other dimension. Ten minutes after a creature is sucked into the mirror, if an ally doesn't rescue the creature with Thievery, it reaches the other dimension, where it might be captured or killed. In the mirror dimension, it counts as a mirror duplicate, so the denizens of the other dimension can't destroy the mirror on their side while the absorbed creature is there. These dimensions are alternate realities, not planes, so even rituals like plane shift can't reach them.

            Complexity: Complex
            Stealth: –10; initiative modifier is +5
            Description: A fire engulfs the western door and a 10-foot-by-10-foot area immediately east of it, then spreads on each of its turns.
            Disable_DC: Disable Eliminating the hazard requires dousing the flames. Water typically clears a 5-foot square if the amount is small (such as that from create water or hydraulic push). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A waterskin doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire. Cold can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is usually less effective than water, so a frost vial typically puts out 1 square of fire, and ray of frost is ineffective. Fountain Circle, located outside town hall, has several working water pumps. These are far enough away that it's impractical for a PC to bring water back and forth. However, a PC might instruct the more steely nerved spectators to create a bucket brigade. It takes 15 spectators (which can include those rescued by councilors as well as by PCs) to set this up, and 2 rounds for the townspeople to line up and begin pumping water from Fountain Circle. As of the 3rd round, there is a bucket of water available for the PCs to use at the chamber's southern entrance at the beginning of each PC's turn. Members of a bucket brigade are lined up outside the chamber, and don't take damage from smoke inhalation. If a PC does want to carry the water, it's 150 feet from the chamber's southern door to a pump, so it 6 actions are usually needed to reach the pumps or return. Filling a bucket requires an Interact action. Other methods might also help control the fire, as you determine. For example, the PCs might be able to find something to barricade the fire with to control its path, or use a cloak to beat out some of the fire.
            Routine: Routine On its turn, the fire spreads into a number of additional squares equal to half the number of squares the fire currently occupies, with a minimum of 1 square. You determine the squares the fire spreads into—typically those with the most flammable materials. Any creature that ends its turn next to the flames takes 1d6 fire damage, and any creature within the flames takes 4d6 fire damage. Both of these have a DC 17 basic Reflex save. A creature can take damage from flames only once per round. (For simplicity, track damage only for the NPCs and their allies, not for the spectators; Turn 5 and Turn 7 have instructions regarding the spectators' health). The fire has an additional effect on each of its turns after the first. Turn 2 The chamber's northern door flies open and flames burst through, igniting the 10-foot-by-10-foot area in front of the door. All fires spread on subsequent turns, at the same rate listed above. Any fires that join together become one fire for this purpose.Turn 4+ Creatures in the room take 1d6 damage from smoke inhalation at the ends of their turns. Anyone who uses an Interact action to tie a wet rag around their nose and mouth (or uses another creative solution) halves the damage. Turn 5 Spectators still inside the room fall unconscious from burns and smoke inhalation. Turn 7 Spectators still in the room die.

Critical Failure The target is controlled by the dragon pillar and remains within 60 feet of it at all times, defending the dragon pillar from all non-Cinderclaws. While a target is controlled, it is treated as a Cinderclaw ally by the dragon pillar. The dragon pillar can control up to 3 targets at a time; any targets in excess who critically fail this saving throw are instead confused for 1d4+1 rounds. A controlled creature can attempt a new Will save once every 24 hours to escape control, but doing so automatically causes the dragon pillar to attack it with a new eye beam to attempt to re-establish control. The control ends if the pillar is destroyed. Yellow Eye Beam (area A12) (electricity) 6d6 electricity damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save). Orange Eye Beam (area A15) (acid) 6d6 acid damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save). Red Eye Beam (area A16) (fire) 6d6 fire damage (DC 24 basic Reflex save).

            Description: Three bulky kegs of black powder placed at key locations in the temple are triggered to explode in unison, causing the entire structure to collapse into rubble and slide partially down the cliff face.
            Disable_DC: Disable No special skills are required to disable this manually activated trap. As an Interact action, a PC can sweep aside some black powder to interrupt the fuse line, but this doesn't prevent Gerhard from activating a keg via blunderbuss. A keg that is removed from its position (either by being thrown over the cliff or merely carried away) retains its explosive potential, but as long as one of the three kegs are removed they no longer have the precise placement required to trigger a collapse—an explosion at this point merely inflicts fire damage in the appropriate areas but does not particularly damage the temple structure itself. A keg's contents can be dispersed by scattering the gunpowder to the wind (most efficiently by pouring it over the cliff side) as a 2-action activity, or rendered permanently inert by pouring a gallon of water into the powder, inhibiting its explosive qualities. The kegs themselves can be destroyed with damage (note that the AC listed below for each keg takes into account the fact that Gerhard has wedged the kegs into nooks in the temple's stone flooring and walls), but note that any fire damage (including incidental fire damage from area effects like a fireball or Gerhard's blunderbuss) causes them to explode. At your option, other actions may be similarly effective at disabling this hazard.

Fire damage in overlapping areas isn't cumulative, but if all three kegs are in their initial positions when the explosion occurs, the temple itself collapses, causing 8d6 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the temple (DC 24 basic Reflex).

            Trigger: Opened Sluices [reaction] Trigger A creature Interacts to throw either the primary lever or backup lever. Effect The trap rolls initiative.
            Routine: (6 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled or destroyed sluice. On each of its actions, the water rushing from the sluices flows through the room, creating a river of churning water that fills the room to several inches and makes the floor of the chamber into difficult terrain. The water level never rises above this level in the room, as it drains out of the chutes to the south and begins to flood the quarry pit (area J2). On the trap's second turn, the water starts filling the four slave pits in area J2. Each of the trap's actions fills the pits 4 inches (2 feet per round if all sluices are functional). If the slave pits fill to their total depth of 12 feet and the grates over the slave pits aren't open, the slaves begin to drown, dying if they aren't freed in 5 rounds. Once the slave pits are full, the water continues to slowly fill the central area over the course of an hour until it empties the reservoir and floods area J2 to a depth of 15 feet. Other options beyond disabling or destroying the sluices could prevent the flooding of the quarry pit at your discretion.
            Reset: The trap resets if all six sluices are closed. If all the water has drained when this occurs, the water takes many months to refill.

            Trigger: Call to Nothingness [reaction] (auditory, divine, enchantment, mental, sonic) Trigger A living creature moves more than 10 feet into area A3; Effect The eerie call of the entropy choir saps the will of living creatures. A living creature who fails a DC 36 Will save becomes slowed 1 as long as they remain in area A3. The entropy choir then rolls initiative.
            Routine: (3 actions; auditory, divine, evocation, sonic) The choir continues to sing its grim dirge every round until it is disabled or destroyed. If there are any non-slowed living creatures in area A3 when its turn starts, it first uses Call to Nothingness as a single action. It uses its remaining actions (or all three actions if there are slowed living creatures in the room already) to focus soul-shattering choruses onto individual targets. The choir can target any living creature in area A3 with an action, but never more than once per round per creature. It prefers to attack slowed creatures over all others, but it targets non-slowed creatures if they're the only viable targets. A targeted creature must attempt a DC 36 Fortitude save.
            R_Critical Success: The target is unaffected.
            R_Success: The target takes 5d6 sonic damage.
            R_Failure: The target takes 10d6 sonic damage.
            R_Critical Failure: The target takes 15d6 sonic damage and increases their drained condition by 1, to a maximum of drained 4.
            Reset: The entropy choir resets automatically after 24 hours, even if it has been disabled or destroyed. It fades away forever once Dwandek and other members of the cult to which it sings its praises are destroyed.

Each round at the start of their turn, the creature takes 4d8 mental damage as they are assaulted by otherworldly visions, and must succeed at a new Will save against the original DC to be ejected from the pocket plane and deposited in the center of area A5.
            Reset: The deathly dream trap resets automatically as long as it hasn't been disabled or destroyed. Each time it resets, the tiny pocket plane of nightmare it sends its victim into resets as well, so no two victims will ever share the same deathly dream.

            Routine: (3 actions) With each action, the auto-turret makes a longrifle Strike against a creature within 60 feet of Tan-Takneh's campsite (other than Tan-Takneh). If there are no such creatures, the auto-turret instead uses its action to sprout mechanical legs, totter 20 feet in the direction of its last target, and then plant itself into the ground again. Programmed to spread its fire around, the auto-turret doesn't attack any creature it's already attacked in the round. After making 15 Strikes, the auto-turret depletes its ammunition and automatically deactivates.

            Description: Ebeshra brushes against a structure, possibly causing it to collapse.
            Disable_DC: Disable DC 43 Athletics (master), Crafting (master), or Engineering Lore (master) to brace the structure to reduce the risk of collapse until the end of the creature's next turn. The DC of the flat check for this round (see Routine) is increased by 4 on a success, or by 8 on a critical success. Increasing the flat check DC to 21 or higher stabilizes the structure, ending this hazard.
            Trigger: Shake Apart [reaction] Trigger Ebeshra applies any amount of force to the structure; Effect The building trembles. The floors of the building and the streets within 30 feet of the building become difficult terrain; creatures on this difficult terrain take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks. The hazard rolls initiative.
            Routine (1 action) The GM rolls a DC 9 flat check to determine if the building partially collapses, increasing the DC as listed above. On a successful check, dust and debris fall within the building and 30 feet around it, providing concealment and dealing 6d6 bludgeoning damage to 1d4 randomly chosen targets (DC 35 basic Reflex save; on a critical failure, the creature is knocked prone). On a critical success, the effect is the same, but the debris deals 12d6 bludgeoning damage to 2d4 randomly chosen targets instead (DC 35 basic Reflex save; on a critical failure, the creature is restrained by rubble until freed [Force Open DC 38, Escape DC 35]).
            Reset: The building becomes susceptible to Shake Apart again 1d6 rounds after it's stabilized.

            Trigger: Fire Pin [reaction] Trigger A creature Ebeshra can see begins to use a teleportation effect or an effect that would move any number of targets to a different plane; Effect Ebeshra hurls a crystal at the triggering creature. The triggering creature and all creatures within 50 feet of the creature take 16d8 piercing damage (DC 45 basic Reflex save) and additional effects based on the result of their save.
            Critical Success: The creature is unaffected.
            Success: The effect is counteracted, and the creature can't use teleportation effects or planar travel effects for 1 minute.
            Failure: As success, but for 1 day instead of 1 minute.
            Critical Failure: As success, but for 1 week instead of 1 minute. Additionally, the creature becomes pinned under the crystal and must succeed at 3 total DC 45 checks to Escape from under the crystal.

            Stealth: +32 (master) to notice Ebeshra twisting its shape in preparation of creating a planar rift
            Description: Ebeshra opens a massive rift in the Material Plane that pulls nearby creatures into another plane entirely. The rift is typically to a random plane in the multiverse, though Ebeshra can have the rift pull creatures into a plane of Ebeshra's choosing. Additionally, Ebeshra can choose any number of creatures to be immune to the effects of the planar rift, usually due to the kaiju recognizing the innocence of the creatures.
            Disable_DC: DC 47 Lore (master) related to the specific plane beyond the rift to disrupt the planar frequency and close the rift, DC 52 Arcana (legendary) or Occultism (legendary) to undo the magical manifestation of the rift, DC 55 Performance (legendary) to play a tone that counteracts the rift's harmonic frequency, or DC 55 Diplomacy (legendary) or Religion (legendary) to plead with Ebeshra to close the rift
            Trigger: Tear Reality [reaction] Trigger Ebeshra recognizes a nearby threat as needing an indisputable resolution, or a deity tasks Ebeshra with creating a planar rift; Effect Ebeshra twists its body, aligning its segmented sections into a fine blade, and cuts the fabric of the Material Plane. It creates an enormous rift in a point in the sky within 1 mile. The rift is 100 feet long and 50 feet wide. The hazard rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The rift pulls creatures within 500 feet toward it. The rift can pull any creature, regardless of its size. Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 45 Fortitude or Reflex save (the creature's choice) to resist the effects of this pull or attempt to grab something to avoid getting pulled. If a creature is directly beneath the rift when the rift pulls it, the creature instead attempts a DC 50 Fortitude or Reflex save (the creature's choice) to avoid being pulled into the rift. On a failure, the creature is pulled up into the rift and thrown to a random point on the plane on the other side.
            Critical Success: The creature resists the pull and doesn't move toward the rift.
            Success: The creature is moved 25 feet toward the rift.
            Failure: The creature is moved 50 feet toward the rift.
            Critical Failure: The creature is moved 100 feet toward the rift. The harsh pull causes the creature to take 10d6 bludgeoning damage.
            Reset: Ebeshra vanishes 1 minute after opening the rift, which closes the rift. Ebeshra must wait 1 week before it can open another planar rift.

            Trigger: Quake [reaction] Trigger Ebeshra moves at least 60 feet on land; Effect The ground shakes in a 120-foot emanation from Ebeshra's space. This creates a variety of effects depending on the surrounding environment. In an area without significant underground space, the ground becomes greater difficult terrain, and creatures on it are flat-footed and clumsy 2 for 1 round. In areas with existing underground spaces (like sewers, sinkholes, or catacombs), fissures open up in the ground. Creatures in the area tumble into the resulting 80-foot-deep hole unless they succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save. In bays, on beaches, and in other relatively substantial but shallow bodies of water, the tremors create dangerous waves. Creatures in the water or within 60 feet of the waterline are struck by waves that deal 10d8 bludgeoning damage (DC 35 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature is instantly swept 60 feet out to sea and 60 feet under the water's surface.
            Reset: Ebeshra doesn't rush this way again for 1d4 rounds.

            Trigger: Lightning Blast [reaction] Trigger A creature takes a hostile action against Ebeshra, produces a visible area effect, or flies within 120 feet of Ebeshra; Effect Ebeshra unleashes a 240-foot line of electricity toward the triggering creature. Creatures in the line take 16d8 electricity damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). The electricity creates a static field in all squares that the line passed through and all adjacent squares. For 1 round, any creatures that enter a space in the static field take 4d8 electricity damage (DC 38 basic Reflex save).

            Complexity: Complex
            Stealth: +16 (expert)
            Description: A whirlwind of four ephemeral, magical threads dispels the undead and shrouds the living in an endless slumber.
            Disable_DC: DC 23 Religion (expert) or DC 21 Performance (trained) to dissipate one of the four threads. Characters who failed or critically failed a Performance check to participate in Grandfather Eiwa's funeral in Chapter 1 have been able to reflect on the experience; these characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their Performance checks to disable this trap. The trap is destroyed when all four threads are dissipated.
            Trigger: Breath of Pharasma [reaction] (divine, necromancy) Trigger A living or undead creature opens the trunk; Effect The ephemeral winds rise, sapping energy. All living and undead creatures within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become slowed 1 (slowed 2 on a critical failure). The trap then rolls initiative.
            Routine: (4 actions) Each thread of energy passes through a random living or undead creature within 60 feet, dealing 4d6 damage (DC 22 basic Will save) to the creature. A thread deals negative damage to living creatures and positive damage to undead creatures. Each thread passes through a different random creature, if possible. Each dissipated thread reduces the trap's number of actions by 1.
            Reset: The haunt deactivates 1 minute after no living or undead creatures are within 100 feet, then resets.

On a failed save, the triggering creature is immobilized (Escape DC 21). This collapse fully blocks the tunnel (area A2), making it impassable.

            Trigger: Shift Roots [reaction] Trigger A creature ends its movement in the grove; Effect The trees throughout the tainted grove shift their roots wildly, making the area difficult terrain, then the Abyss-warped trees roll initiative. Tighten Grip [free-action] Trigger The Abyss-warped trees critically hit a creature with a branch Strike; Effect The Abyss-warped trees loop their branches around the triggering creature, grabbing it (Escape DC 21).
            Routine: (4 actions) The Abyss-warped trees use their first action each round to lash their roots; each creature in the tainted grove must succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save or fall prone. The Abyss-warped trees use their second, third, and fourth actions to make branch Strikes against up to three different creatures in the tainted grove. Melee branch +14, Damage 2d8+5 bludgeoning
            Reset: Abyss-warped trees cease moving 1 minute after no living creatures are in the tainted grove. They reset immediately. A disabled tree reanimates after 1 minute. A destroyed tree regrows after 1 month.

            Disable_DC: DC 22 Diplomacy (trained) to soothe the restless spirits, or DC 24 Religion (trained) to recite a prayer honoring the deceased; two successful checks are required to disable the haunt
            Trigger: Final Flight [reaction] (illusion, mental, occult) Trigger A creature enters the gathering circle; Effect The triggering creature experiences the last moments of the priest who once tended the Lea of Honored Souls. Griffons swoop down from the sky and snatch the priest up in their claws, dealing 1d8+7 slashing damage. They're carried southwest across the valley to a mountain peak and dropped into a nest of young griffons. As the chicks devour the priest, the character takes 1d8+7 piercing damage and 2d8 mental damage. The affected creature must then attempt a DC 22 Will save.
            Critical Success: The creature is unaffected.
            Success: The creature takes half damage from all damage dealt by the haunt.
            Failure: The creature takes full damage.
            Critical Failure: The creature takes full damage and can't shake off the vision; they take 1d8 persistent bleed damage and are frightened 1—believing they're being eaten alive—as long as the bleed damage persists.
            Reset: The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all living creatures leave the Lea of Honored Souls. Ten minutes after deactivating, the haunt resets.

            Trigger: Ancestral Journey [reaction] Trigger A good-aligned spiritual descendant of the Burning Mammoth following enters the mountain pass; Effect Burning Mammoths from long ago appear alongside the party, walking the mountain pass as one united following.

        Forest Fire:
            Level: 4
            Trait:
              - Environmental
              - Fire
            Source: Pathfinder 176 Lost Mammoth Valley Page 35
            Complexity: Complex
            Stealth: -10
            Description: A 10-foot-by-10-foot bonfire spreads to the surrounding forest on each of its turns.
            Disable_DC: Disable A successful DC 22 Athletics, Nature, or Survival check from an adjacent square is sufficient to smother one 5-foot-square of fire; each attempt is an Interact action. Dousing the flames automatically extinguishes one or more sections of fire, with no check. Water typically clears a 5-foot square if the amount is small (such as from a spell like create water or hydraulic push). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A waterskin doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire. Cold can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is less effective than water, so a frost vial puts out only 1 square of fire, and a ray of frost is ineffective.
            Trigger: Stoke Flames [reaction] Trigger A brimorak urges the fire to spread out of control; Effect The bonfire becomes a forest fire and rolls initiative.
            Routine: On its turn, the fire spreads into a number of additional squares equal to half the number of squares the fire currently occupies (minimum 1 square). You determine the squares the fire spreads into. Any creature that ends its turn next to the flames takes 2d8+5 fire damage, or 4d8+10 fire damage if it ended its turn within the flames (DC 25 basic Reflex save in either case). A creature can take damage from the forest fire only once per round.

            Complexity: Simple
            Stealth: DC 25 (expoert) or detect magic
            Description: Necromantic runes inscribed on the cage bars and lock drain the vitality of living creatures who interact with the cage.
            Disable_DC: Disable Thievery DC 25 (expert) to drain the runes power harmlessly or dispel magic (3rd level; counteract DC 22) to counteract the rune
            Trigger: Soul Drain [reaction] (arcane, necromancy, negative) Trigger A creature touches the cage bars, door, or lock directly or with a tool; Effect The trap deals 4d8+18 negative damage to the triggering creature, creatures inside the cage, and all creatures adjacent to the cage (DC 27 basic Fortitude save). On a failed save, a creature is also drained 1.

            Complexity: Complex
            Stealth: +30 (legendary) to distinguish between the hazard and the oozes within it; DC 0 to notice the pool
            Description: A shallow, foul-smelling puddle of toxic acid blocks a narrow hall, and poison bursts from it when disturbed.
            Disable_DC: DC 40 Crafting (master) or DC 42 Survival (legendary) to neutralize the acid while within reach of it. Three successes using either skill (or a combination of both) destroys the hazard. Deadly Footing The area of the venom pool is difficult terrain, and each creature moving through it takes 10 acid damage for every square of its area that it moves into.
            Trigger: Poison Puff [reaction] Trigger A creature moves through any square in the hazard's space; Effect The pool produces a 9th-level cloudkill (DC 40) at its center. It then rolls initiative.\
            Routine: (2 actions) The hazard uses its first action to spread 10 feet down the hallway in both directions. Once out of the hall, each side spreads in a random direction each round, but they don't go through doors. The hazard uses its second action to move the center of the cloudkill up to 20 feet in any direction to which any part of the pool has line of effect (normally, to encompass the greatest number of characters). If the cloudkill isn't present, it instead uses its second action to produce a new cloudkill, as Poison Puff.
            Reset: The hazard ends after 1 minute, contracting to its original size and keeping still until disturbed again.

            Trigger: Flame Spurt [reaction] Trigger A creature moves within 5 feet of the flue; Effect A fiery geyser of flaming gas explodes from the ground. Creatures within 5 feet of the flue take 4d10 fire damage (DC 30 basic Reflex save); creatures that fail the save also take 4d10 persistent fire damage.
