Effect The triggering creature and up to five coconspirators instantly revert to infants, losing all memories, class abilities, and other skills acquired during their lives (DC 44 Fortitude negates). Reversing this effect is nearly impossible, requiring powerful magic such as wish.

            Description: A roiling red orb, forged from a drop of the god Rovagug’s blood, rains fire from the sky when a specified condition is met.
            Disable_DC: Thievery DC 48 (legendary) to imbue thieves’ tools with aspects representing Asmodeus and Sarenrae and use them to drain away the orb’s power over 10 minutes; the character attempting this check takes 5 fire damage each round until the orb is depleted
            Trigger: Burn It All [reaction] (death, divine, evocation, fire); Trigger A special condition set by the trap’s creator occurs; this is typically the event of their death. Effect Fire rains from the sky in a 100-mile radius, dealing 10d6 fire damage to creatures and objects in the area. Each creature or object can attempt a DC 46 basic Reflex save. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly. This is not enough damage to completely burn away a forest or level an entire mountain or city, but it typically kills most creatures in the area.

            Disable_DC: Acrobatics DC 15 to approach without triggering the trap followed by Thievery DC 17 (trained) to erase the rune, or dispel magic (1st level; counteract DC 15) to counteract the rune
            Trigger: Summon Monster [reaction] (arcane, conjuration, summon); Trigger A creature enters the cloud of magical sensors. Effect This trap summons a specific level 1 creature, determined when the trap is created. The creature rolls initiative and remains for 2d6 rounds, after which the spell ends and the creature disappears. The creature also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The summoned creature can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.
            Reset: The trap resets each day at dawn
            Upgrade: You can make a summoning rune of nearly any level. It summons a creature of a level equal to the trap’s level. Use Table 10–5 DCs by Level on page 503 to determine the Thievery DC and spell DC, using the trap’s level and applying a hard adjustment (+2). The Stealth modifier for the trap is equal to this number – 10. Stronger summoning runes usually require expert proficiency or better in Perception to find, and they might require a higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable.

            Trigger: Pitfall [reaction] Trigger A creature walks onto the trapdoor. Effect The triggering creature falls in and takes damage from the fall, reduced by 5 feet for falling into the water (typically 12 bludgeoning damage). A creature can Grab an Edge to avoid falling. The trapdoor then slams shut, and the hazard rolls initiative.
            Routine: (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn for each disabled water spout. On each of the trap’s actions, a spout pours water, increasing the depth of the water by 5 feet. Once the pit is full of water, the pit stops using actions, but creatures in the pit begin drowning.
            Reset: The trap can be reset if the door is manually reengaged and the water tanks refilled; it can be reset without draining the pit, but doing so renders it less effective.

            Description: A 15-foot-wide patch of water and sand attempts to submerge creatures that step onto it.
            Disable_DC: Survival DC 18 (trained) to disturb the surface
            Trigger: Submerge [free-action] Trigger A Huge or smaller creature walks onto the quicksand. Effect The triggering creature sinks into the quicksand up to its waist. The quicksand rolls initiative if it hasn’t already.
            Routine: Routine (1 action) On its initiative, the quicksand pulls down each creature within it. A creature that was submerged up to its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and has to hold its breath to avoid suffocation. A creature in the quicksand can attempt a DC 20 Athletics check to Swim to either raise itself by one step if it’s submerged to its neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if it’s submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. A creature that Swims out of the quicksand escapes the hazard and is prone in a space adjacent to the quicksand patch. Other creatures can Aid the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own DC 20 Athletics check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check.
            Reset: The hazard still submerges anyone who walks in, but the surface doesn’t become hidden again until it settles over the course of 24 hours.

            Routine: Routine (3 actions) The trap uses its first action to make a spinning blade Strike against each adjacent creature, its second action to move straight in a random direction (roll 1d4 to determine the direction), and its third action to make a spinning blade Strike against each adjacent creature. This trap doesn’t take a multiple attack penalty. Speed 10 feet Melee [one-action] spinning blade +12, Damage 2d10+5 slashing

            Routine: Routine (2 actions) On its initiative, the trap uses its first action to spin, then stops. Roll 1d6 to determine which segment is topmost when the wheel stops spinning. The wheel uses its second action to replicate the spell listed for that segment (3rd level, DC 24, spell attack roll +14). This spell’s target is centered on or otherwise includes the nearest creature in the area. This increases the spell’s range to 100 feet if necessary. Any spell cast by this trap is arcane. Spells are sleep, paralyze, lightning bolt (100-foot line), blindness, acid arrow, ray of enfeeblement.
            Reset: The trap deactivates and resets if 1 minute passes without any creature moving within range of its sensor.

            Routine: Routine (1 action) The trap launches one dart against every creature in the gallery as 1 action.

            Trigger: Flume Activation [reaction] Trigger A creature tries to leave the room. Effect The exits seal instantly and the trap rolls initiative.
            Routine: Routine (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled channel each turn. On each action, a different channel spews lava, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each creature within 10 feet of the channel (DC 27 basic Reflex save), and increasing the depth of the lava in the room by 1 foot (4 feet per round if all the channels are active). A creature that starts its turn in lava takes 8d6 fire damage and is immobilized until it Escapes the hardening lava (DC 27). The creature might suffocate if covered in lava. Lava from the previous round hardens fully at the start of the trap’s turn, effectively raising the floor of the room. Once the room is full of lava, the trap stops taking actions, but creatures in the room remain stuck until the floor opens and the trap resets.
            Reset: The trap deactivates and resets after 1 hour by withdrawing the floor, cracking and dumping the hardened lava (and any creatures trapped inside) into the chamber. Creatures fall 40 feet, taking falling damage (typically 17 bludgeoning damage).

            Trigger: Agitate [reaction] (arcane, evocation); Trigger A creature stays in the room for at least 6 seconds. Effect Each telekinetic decoration constructs a cloud of objects in the room (three clouds total) and the trap rolls initiative. The creatures in the room when the trap is triggered become the trap’s targets, regardless of whether they leave the room or other creatures later enter the room. Each decoration targets a different creature if possible. A target creature that moves at least 1 mile from the trap ceases being a target, at which point the decoration designates a new target.
            Routine: Routine (9 actions) Each decoration uses 3 of the trap’s actions each turn, and the trap loses 3 actions each turn for every decoration that is disabled. A decoration uses its first action to move its cloud of objects up to 200 feet, its second action to make the objects Strike, and its third action to add more objects to the cloud, increasing its damage by 1d12 (to a maximum of 4d12+10). If a decoration’s cloud is already at maximum damage, it does nothing with its third action. If a decoration’s cloud has been destroyed, the decoration instead spends its first action to create a new cloud of objects inside the room (using the starting damage value) and then its second and third actions to have the cloud move and attack. Melee [one-action] objects +24, Damage 2d12+10 bludgeoning
            Reset: The trap deactivates and resets 10 minutes after it has no target creatures (because the creatures either moved too far away or died).

Effect The mirror absorbs the creature into the mirror, replacing it with an evil mirror duplicate (DC 34 Reflex to avoid being absorbed into the mirror), and rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The mirror absorbs another reflected creature into the mirror and replaces it with a mirror duplicate. Mirror duplicates attack on their own initiative, using the same statistics as the original creature, but with an evil alignment (changing only abilities that shift with the alignment change). A mirror duplicate can spend 3 actions in contact with the mirror to return to its original dimension and release the creature it duplicated, but most mirror duplicates prefer not to.
            Reset: The mirror is always ready to absorb creatures into the other dimension. Ten minutes after a creature is sucked into the mirror, if an ally doesn't rescue the creature with Thievery, it reaches the other dimension, where it might be captured or killed. In the mirror dimension, it counts as a mirror duplicate, so the denizens of the other dimension can't destroy the mirror on their side while the absorbed creature is there. These dimensions are alternate realities, not planes, so even spells like plane shift can't reach them.

            Trigger: Scream [reaction] Trigger Three or more living creatures remain within 100 feet of the trap for 6 seconds or longer. Effect The trap releases an arcane wail of the banshee (DC 40) with a 100-foot-radius emanation instead of 40 feet, targeting all living creatures in the area, and rolls initiative.
            Routine: Routine (1 action) The trap uses its action to force one random creature that failed its save against wail of the banshee last turn to emit a wail of the banshee with the same statistics as the initial one. The creature wails even if it is dead or unable to speak, no matter how far away from the trap it is. Unlike a casting of the spell, the drained condition from this trap’s wail of the banshee spells increases the targets’ drained condition values. A creature that critically succeeds at any of its saves can still be affected by the trap on future rounds, but can’t be forced to wail by the trap.
            Reset: The trap ends when the trap is unable to make a creature scream (usually because no creature failed its save on the previous turn or because all creatures have critically succeeded in the past). It then resets over 24 hours, as a new scream builds up in the mummified larynx.

            Success: The creature takes half damage.
            Failure: The creature takes full damage and is moved 10 feet along with the water.

            Special:Acidic Runoff This caustic flood dissolves flesh as it moves, dealing 1d12 bludgeoning damage and 1d12+8 acid damage. Additionally, it deals 2d6 persistent acid damage to creatures who critically fail their Fortitude saves. Battering Waves This flood of rushing water deals 2d12+10 bludgeoning damage. Repulsive Refuse This flood has picked up tainted or disease-ridden objects like sewer runoff or rotting food. It deals 2d12+8 bludgeoning damage. Each creature exposed to the flood must attempt a DC 29 Fortitude save, becoming sickened 1 on a failure or sickened 2 on a critical failure. Additionally, creatures who come into contact with the flood waters are exposed to filth fever (DC 20 Fortitude). Sharp Debris The waters have picked up various objects, some of which are particularly sharp. The flood deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage and 1d12+12 piercing damage. Sticky Goo The substance is particularly sticky. It deals 2d12+6 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, each creature in the flood must attempt a DC 29 Reflex save at the beginning of their turn each round. On a failed saving throw, they take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all their Speeds for 1 round. On a critical failure, they are instead immobilized for 1 round.

            Success: The creature is flat-footed and cannot use reactions. Additionally, it must spend 1 of its actions each round dancing. Dancing is a move action that allows the creature to Stride up to half its Speed.

            Routine: (1 action; auditory, enchantment, incapacitation, occult) The orchestra performs a raucous tune, compelling all creatures that can hear it to spend actions dancing. Each round, creature must attempt a DC 37 Will save; the results of this save modify the number of actions that the creature must spend dancing each round. If this would cause the creature to spend more actions dancing than it can use on its turn, the creature takes 10d6 damage (or double that on a critical failure) from moving faster than its body can manage.
            Critical Success: The creature decreases the number of actions it must spend dancing by 1.
            Success: No effect.

The creature can use a free action, which has the concentrate trait, to choose any direction they wish for gravity to pull them. This allows a creature to Stride along any surface or Fly in a straight line by choosing a direction into midair. For unattended objects and mindless creatures, this is microgravity: they float in place unless pushed off a surface.
            Routine: (1 action) Winds blow through the area in a random direction, causing creatures and objects within 50 feet of the air rift to float up, down, north, south, east, or west (roll a d6 to determine which direction). Creatures and objects in the area must attempt a DC 37 Fortitude save. If a creature is pushed into a solid object or another creature by this effect, both take 3d8+15 bludgeoning damage on impact.

Creatures in the area tumble into the resulting 40-foot-deep hole unless they succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save. In bays, on beaches, and in other relatively substantial but shallow bodies of water, Mogaru's movement creates dangerous waves. Creatures in the water or within 60 feet of the waterline are struck by waves that deal 3d8 bludgeoning damage (DC 35 basic Reflex save).

            Disable_DC: DC 43 Athletics (master), Crafting (master), or Engineering Lore (master) to brace the structure to reduce the risk of collapse until the end of the creature's next turn. The DC of the flat check for this round (see Routine) is increased by 4 on a success, or by 8 on a critical success. Increasing the flat check DC to 21 or higher stabilizes the structure, ending this hazard.
            Trigger: Shake Apart [reaction] Trigger Mogaru applies any amount of force to the structure; Effect The building trembles. The floors of the building and the streets within 30 feet of the building become difficult terrain; creatures on this difficult terrain take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks. The hazard rolls initiative.
            Routine: (1 action) The GM rolls a DC 9 flat check to determine if the building collapses, increasing the DC as listed above. On a successful check, dust and debris fall within the building and 30 feet around it, providing concealment and dealing 6d6 bludgeoning damage to 1d4 randomly chosen targets (DC 35 basic Reflex save; on a critically failed save, the creature is knocked prone). On a critical success, the effect is the same, but the debris deals 12d6 bludgeoning damage to 2d4 randomly chosen targets instead (DC 35 basic Reflex save; on a critically failed Reflex save, the creature is restrained by rubble until freed [Force Open DC 38, Escape DC 35]).
            Reset: The building becomes susceptible to Shake Apart again 1d6 rounds after it is stabilized.

            Routine: (1 action) The mirror absorbs another reflected creature into the mirror and replaces it with a mirror duplicate. Mirror duplicates attack on their own initiative, using the same statistics as the original creature, but with an evil alignment (changing only abilities that shift with the alignment change). A mirror duplicate can spend 3 actions in contact with the mirror to return to its original dimension and release the creature it duplicated, but most mirror duplicates prefer not to.
            Reset: The mirror is always ready to absorb creatures into the other dimension. Ten minutes after a creature is sucked into the mirror, if an ally doesn't rescue the creature with Thievery, it reaches the other dimension, where it might be captured or killed. In the mirror dimension, it counts as a mirror duplicate, so the denizens of the other dimension can't destroy the mirror on their side while the absorbed creature is there. These dimensions are alternate realities, not planes, so even rituals like plane shift can't reach them.

            Description: A fire engulfs the western door and a 10-foot-by-10-foot area immediately east of it, then spreads on each of its turns.
            Disable_DC: Disable Eliminating the hazard requires dousing the flames. Water typically clears a 5-foot square if the amount is small (such as that from create water or hydraulic push). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10-foot-by-10-foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A waterskin doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire. Cold can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is usually less effective than water, so a frost vial typically puts out 1 square of fire, and ray of frost is ineffective. Fountain Circle, located outside town hall, has several working water pumps. These are far enough away that it's impractical for a PC to bring water back and forth. However, a PC might instruct the more steely nerved spectators to create a bucket brigade. It takes 15 spectators (which can include those rescued by councilors as well as by PCs) to set this up, and 2 rounds for the townspeople to line up and begin pumping water from Fountain Circle. As of the 3rd round, there is a bucket of water available for the PCs to use at the chamber's southern entrance at the beginning of each PC's turn. Members of a bucket brigade are lined up outside the chamber, and don't take damage from smoke inhalation. If a PC does want to carry the water, it's 150 feet from the chamber's southern door to a pump, so it 6 actions are usually needed to reach the pumps or return. Filling a bucket requires an Interact action. Other methods might also help control the fire, as you determine. For example, the PCs might be able to find something to barricade the fire with to control its path, or use a cloak to beat out some of the fire.
            Routine: Routine On its turn, the fire spreads into a number of additional squares equal to half the number of squares the fire currently occupies, with a minimum of 1 square. You determine the squares the fire spreads into—typically those with the most flammable materials. Any creature that ends its turn next to the flames takes 1d6 fire damage, and any creature within the flames takes 4d6 fire damage. Both of these have a DC 17 basic Reflex save. A creature can take damage from flames only once per round. (For simplicity, track damage only for the NPCs and their allies, not for the spectators; Turn 5 and Turn 7 have instructions regarding the spectators' health). The fire has an additional effect on each of its turns after the first. Turn 2 The chamber's northern door flies open and flames burst through, igniting the 10-foot-by-10-foot area in front of the door. All fires spread on subsequent turns, at the same rate listed above. Any fires that join together become one fire for this purpose.Turn 4+ Creatures in the room take 1d6 damage from smoke inhalation at the ends of their turns. Anyone who uses an Interact action to tie a wet rag around their nose and mouth (or uses another creative solution) halves the damage. Turn 5 Spectators still inside the room fall unconscious from burns and smoke inhalation. Turn 7 Spectators still in the room die.

            Disable_DC: Disable No special skills are required to disable this manually activated trap. As an Interact action, a PC can sweep aside some black powder to interrupt the fuse line, but this doesn't prevent Gerhard from activating a keg via blunderbuss. A keg that is removed from its position (either by being thrown over the cliff or merely carried away) retains its explosive potential, but as long as one of the three kegs are removed they no longer have the precise placement required to trigger a collapse—an explosion at this point merely inflicts fire damage in the appropriate areas but does not particularly damage the temple structure itself. A keg's contents can be dispersed by scattering the gunpowder to the wind (most efficiently by pouring it over the cliff side) as a 2-action activity, or rendered permanently inert by pouring a gallon of water into the powder, inhibiting its explosive qualities. The kegs themselves can be destroyed with damage (note that the AC listed below for each keg takes into account the fact that Gerhard has wedged the kegs into nooks in the temple's stone flooring and walls), but note that any fire damage (including incidental fire damage from area effects like a fireball or Gerhard's blunderbuss) causes them to explode.

Fire damage in overlapping areas isn't cumulative, but if all three kegs are in their initial positions when the explosion occurs, the temple itself collapses, causing 8d6 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the temple (DC 24 basic Reflex).

            Routine: (6 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled or destroyed sluice. On each of its actions, the water rushing from the sluices flows through the room, creating a river of churning water that fills the room to several inches and makes the floor of the chamber into difficult terrain. The water level never rises above this level in the room, as it drains out of the chutes to the south and begins to flood the quarry pit (area J2). On the trap's second turn, the water starts filling the four slave pits in area J2. Each of the trap's actions fills the pits 4 inches (2 feet per round if all sluices are functional). If the slave pits fill to their total depth of 12 feet and the grates over the slave pits aren't open, the slaves begin to drown, dying if they aren't freed in 5 rounds. Once the slave pits are full, the water continues to slowly fill the central area over the course of an hour until it empties the reservoir and floods area J2 to a depth of 15 feet. Other options beyond disabling or destroying the sluices could prevent the flooding of the quarry pit at your discretion.
            Reset: The trap resets if all six sluices are closed. If all the water has drained when this occurs, the water takes many months to refill.

            Description: A small-scale version of a dragonstorm—a churning vortex of wind infused with fire, acid, lightning, poison, and ice—fills Alseta's Ring.
            Disable_DC: Disable Religion DC 40 (legendary) to call out to a non-evil deity for direct intervention to disperse the lesser dragonstorm (prayers to Apsu allow characters who are masters in Religion to attempt the check as if they were legendary instead), Thievery DC 42 (legendary) to deactivate Vengegate while the manifestation is forcing it open, or a successful dispel magic (10th level; DC 40) to counteract the lesser dragonstorm.

Affected creatures take 10d8 damage (DC 46 basic Reflex save), evenly split between acid, cold, fire, electricity, and poison. Creatures that fail their save are pulled 20 feet toward the center of Alseta's Ring (or are knocked prone and pulled 30 feet on a critical failure). After 10 rounds, the lesser dragonstorm is destroyed, but a much greater dragonstorm manifests in the surrounding region—see The Dragonstorm on page 7.
